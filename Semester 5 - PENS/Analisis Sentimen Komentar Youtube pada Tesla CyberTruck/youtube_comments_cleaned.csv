"I don't know why people get the idea that hospital bills in the US are insane here inside this comment section. My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. 

These black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). 

We also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.

Crime rate? 

Luxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.
Latvia has a 4.05%.
Finland has a 1.5%.
Turkey has a 2.46%.
Estonia has a 1.35%.
Lithuania is 2.21%.

What about the US?

Maine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!
New Hampshire is 1.26%
Connecticut is 1.5%
Mississippi is 2.45%
Kentucky is 2.14%

Is the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.

I find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy?

"I was invited to the second step and gave Tesla  another $1000. There‚Äôs something off though so let me know what you think:
1. I did the original preorder in June 2021. I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!
2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven

Does this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas. Where can I see reliable information on how many cars they made and how many preorders still exist?

"Yeah Marques I'm gonna be honest I've been kinda falling out of love with your reviews the last few years and I think this was the final nail in the coffin. Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn't take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the ""most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck"" while speeding past it's more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. Hell, if anything the more real ""danger"" is that I'd be willing to bet a significant amount of drivers will be nastier to and more inclined to drive aggressively around a Cybertruck than other vehicles. 

I just kinda feel like if you're not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?

A truck that is more dangerous to everyone around it AND the people inside it compared top most vehicles on the road, that has horrific quality control issues, rusts if you look at it funny, AND it blinds people nearby thanks to it being a glare magnet.

I mean it is iconic, for being an absloute disaster.

Also its not surprising that a tech channel didnt even touch on how dangerous sharp angles are to pedestrians, but it is dissapointing. Cars are a massive killer and making one of the deadliest types of car (pickup trucks) even deadlier for looks especially when most pickup truck owners dont need to own one. Most of the need is better served by vans and for the bit where a pickup truck is needed, the bedspace of modern (especially teslas) pickup trucks is bs. 

Oh also bulletproof steel? its bullet resistence is far overstated. 

Personal vehicles dont exist in a vacuum and glossing over its myriad of flaws is promoting a vehicle that is unnecessarily dangerous just because, and it is not fine because it looks good, it makes streets mroe dangeorus, it makes congestion worse, it does mroe damage to roads, and for what, it looking cooler?","wow, truck, le, storage, modern, truck, older, truck, suv, van, even, sedan, hell, even, cargo, bike, comparbale, truck, dangerous, everyone, around, people, inside, compared, top, vehicle, road, horrific, quality, control, issue, rust, look, funny, blind, people, nearby, thanks, glare, magnet, mean, iconic, absloute, disaster, also, surprising, tech, channel, didnt, even, touch, dangerous, sharp, angle, pedestrian, dissapointing, car, massive, killer, making, one, deadliest, type, car, pickup, truck, even, deadlier, look, especially, pickup, truck, owner, dont, need, one, need, better, served, van, bit, pickup, truck, needed, bed, space, modern, especially, tesla, pickup, truck, b, oh, also, bulletproof, steel, bullet, resistence, far, overstated, personal, vehicle, dont, exist, vacuum, glossing, myriad, flaw, promoting, vehicle, unnecessarily, dangerous, fine, look, good, make, street, mroe, dangeorus, make, congestion, worse, mroe, damage, road, looking, cooler"

The impact on environment and infrastructure is arguably even worse though. The sheer mass of this thing makes it so insanely bad. 

This thing is basically two Teslas stuffed into a one to achieve pretty much nothing except literally exponentially more impact on the tires and asphalt.

"A few things you left out in this video: 
1 The bulletproof exterior isn't just overrated, its dangerous. Cars are made to crumple so that the kinetic energy, the force of the crash goes through the car itself instead of your body. Whiplash at best and seriously injured at worst from a simple crash. 
2 You did not mention the ""Car wash mode"" at all. They did not make the seals to the power points well enough to keep water out so they made that mode to close those parts and protect the car. But if you have adhd like me or just having a stressful/busy day, you will forget and brick your 'truck'. Not to mention I've seen posts about this happening and it will void the warranty so you're screwed. 
3 You did mention that the windows are stronger than normal but, specifically they are meant to be shatterproof. Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can't say ive seen one submerged so i don't know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? 
4 You didn't mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don't know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this 'truck' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in?

"Yeah the way it makes other people behave has nothing to do with how it blinds them. Or all the other issues, that we can see it has very bad viewer angles.
That we know many big cars SUV has huge issues with outward vision area. And this car even more.
I don't know what it is but this seems a Amway to again trying to shift the blame away from a very ill designed car with a huge amount of hazardous errors and bad design.

No its all the other drivers.
Also here is another thought.
The amount of many design flaws , ACCUMULATES to make it much much worse.
The way you've start you carelessly redirects from the flaws as if they can be dismissed one by one.
Showing you have no concept or idea or what makes something bad or Ill designed or many other things.

Again excuses for Tesla and seemingly anything Elon Musk works on, when repeatedly the my make mistakes in a large number of things that are well-known within car design and construction knowledge and shouldn't happen so frequently and in so many numbers.
All companies will make errors and almost all cars will have some flaws that could have been avoided.
But the sheer size and amount that Tesla does is staggering, and we have a tech section that again and again comes with justifications and excuses, and when they do that they make our roads more unsafe , and let them off the hook.","yeah, way, make, people, behave, nothing, blind, issue, see, bad, viewer, angle, know, many, big, car, suv, huge, issue, outward, vision, area, car, even, dont, know, seems, amway, trying, shift, blame, away, ill, designed, car, huge, amount, hazardous, error, bad, design, driver, also, another, thought, amount, many, design, flaw, accumulates, make, much, much, worse, way, youve, start, carelessly, redirects, flaw, dismissed, one, one, showing, concept, idea, make, something, bad, ill, designed, many, thing, excuse, tesla, seemingly, anything, elon, musk, work, repeatedly, make, mistake, large, number, thing, wellknown, within, car, design, construction, knowledge, shouldnt, happen, frequently, many, number, company, make, error, almost, car, flaw, could, avoided, sheer, size, amount, tesla, staggering, tech, section, come, justification, excuse, make, road, unsafe, let, hook"

"Idk Mk there's a lot of things that you left out of this review or at least could have mentioned that make it feel like you were intentionally going soft of Tesla for one reason or another:
1. The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).
2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place
3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof
4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.
5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn't at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the ""iconic design"" 
6. For health and safety reasons it is entirely irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors actually are, I have seen videos of carrots getting sliced and chopped against the edges of the door, they're like fucking katanas üòÇ.
Anyway, I hope in a year or so we can get a more well rounded review from you tackling the issues I've just highlighted, especially number 6 because if anyone who owns a toddler has designs on buying this dumb truck, they should at least know that it comes with the possibility of leaving their toddler devoid of a finger or two.","idk, mk, there, lot, thing, left, review, least, could, mentioned, make, feel, like, intentionally, going, soft, tesla, one, reason, another, stainless, steel, panel, rust, easily, anything, dead, bug, bird, droppings, lead, rusting, panel, start, change, colour, exposed, water, whilst, sun, something, like, second, ct, avoid, rusting, problem, tesla, charge, k, put, protective, coating, panel, put, first, place, panel, fucking, bulletproof, drag, racing, pretty, dumb, going, towing, stuff, either, one, could, argue, people, buy, ct, likely, tow, something, ever, form, race, truck, tiny, bay, bigger, average, suzuki, light, truck, important, bit, information, considering, bay, size, dictate, much, potentially, carry, didnt, dwell, part, briefly, touched, saying, crew, use, move, equipment, exactly, much, equipment, bro, surely, caould, taken, minute, show, many, grocery, bag, suitcase, fit, bay, taken, le, minute, glazing, iconic, design, health, safety, reason, entirely, irresponsible, accurately, communicate, much, bruising, cutting, hazard, sharp, steel, edge, door, actually, seen, video, carrot, getting, sliced, chopped, edge, door, theyre, like, fucking, katanas, anyway, hope, year, get, well, rounded, review, tackling, issue, ive, highlighted, especially, number, anyone, owns, toddler, design, buying, dumb, truck, least, know, come, possibility, leaving, toddler, devoid, finger, two"

"Owning (or wanting to own) a Cybertruck is the new Mid-Life Crisis cry for help/desperate bid to be relevant. It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.

Another fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway.","owning, wanting, cybertruck, new, midlife, crisis, cry, helpdesperate, bid, relevant, like, honda, ridgeline, drawn, year, old, made, company, whose, grifter, ceo, act, like, year, old, tesla, already, epitome, form, function, due, prioritizing, aesthetic, high, profit, margin, example, removing, radar, ultrasonic, sensor, cheaper, optical, camera, model, take, new, low, hideous, form, ive, seen, several, person, standard, one, wrap, theyre, hideous, ridiculous, production, quality, predictably, horrible, production, issue, addressed, video, inexcusable, tiny, run, luxury, vehicle, repair, absurdly, expensive, brake, light, dont, work, properly, actual, utility, mentioned, video, laughable, low, towing, power, cant, fit, much, truck, bed, difficulty, going, incline, vehicle, climb, ease, range, significantly, le, advertised, battery, compartment, half, full, need, cleaned, shortly, getting, wet, tesla, even, say, shouldnt, take, car, wash, bulletproof, except, small, percentage, handgun, height, design, vehicle, make, difficult, see, pedestrian, front, yoke, steering, wheel, also, known, safety, hazard, hey, guess, another, fun, fact, working, tesla, dangerous, company, infamous, ignoring, safety, best, practice, factory, musk, hate, color, yellow, doesnt, like, safety, sign, doesnt, like, beeping, noise, sure, even, care, factory, look, like, since, he, engineer, apparently, doesnt, care, condition, tesla, vehicle, leave, factory, he, twitter, time, anyway"

"In the current age of mass information - nothing material can be iconic. There is nothing that is unbelievable or not seen before. The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written ""PAPA"", which is Pope in italian. But not ""the Pope"" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just ""PAPA"". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today's world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and ""in GOD we TRUST"" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a ""Verified"" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real ""devine"" person. There is this show on NG ""The best of the decades""... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn't rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten.","current, age, mass, information, nothing, material, iconic, nothing, unbelievable, seen, social, network, made, sharing, idea, available, absolutely, every, person, world, invention, became, trend, misteries, became, debunked, comment, hero, became, influencers, order, monetize, status, fine, product, reality, live, instagram, trojan, war, achilles, would, viral, star, leave, hector, alive, make, podcast, later, youtube, last, week, exploring, milano, one, evening, waiting, metro, arrive, multiple, screen, wall, station, showing, pope, reading, statesments, situation, israel, bottom, banner, brief, information, left, written, papa, pope, italian, pope, il, papa, pope, francis, papa, around, people, around, may, one, watching, broadcast, pope, nobody, interested, italy, imagine, th, century, would, see, listen, pope, one, kind, experience, life, almost, like, devine, moment, influencers, give, money, last, one, leaving, red, circle, ground, important, people, pope, difference, nobody, interested, mr, beast, human, even, youtube, genius, interested, money, exposure, need, either, earn, easy, money, receive, gigantic, advertising, hence, earn, lot, money, legend, price, turn, bestseller, mr, beast, never, icon, cybertruck, never, icon, today, world, impossible, money, god, internet, god, trust, trust, believe, saint, halo, verified, badge, need, see, order, sure, real, devine, person, show, ng, best, decade, show, icon, decade, icon, decade, saint, icon, year, happens, bind, virtue, money, future, human, kind, doesnt, rely, popular, relies, sustainable, society, real, science, knowledge, real, art, real, life, virtue, brought, u, st, century, considered, true, genius, life, aspect, become, true, icon, cybertruck, cool, truck, cool, story, year, elon, musk, considered, genius, even, year, elon, icon, cybertruck, nobody, remembers, millionaire, salzburg, time, mozart, mozart, still, considered, one, greatest, genius, music, time, nobody, speaks, wealthy, noble, ordered, da, vinci, paint, da, vinci, still, considered, science, art, genius, almost, year, already, purpose, give, human, kind, good, future, extinct, human, kind, exists, around, million, year, modern, world, society, exists, two, century, frighteningly, close, reverse, process, idea, make, people, good, hearted, educated, society, sustainable, keep, icon, alive, everything, life, shortly, forgotten"

"Electric Car Company Loses over $500m after Customers Reviews.

A YouTuber, Marques Brownlee using the MKBHD handled reviewed an electric car called Fisker and on his YouTube channel, shared his damning observations of the car. 

He did this despite the car company asking him to wait for the software update that they said was coming to the vehicle.
 
According to MKBHD, he is reviewing it because the company had made the product public and was actually selling to customers.

Following his review where he called it the worst car he has ever reviewed, which had over 4 million views and other inefficiencies of the car company, Fisker has now recorded a net loss of over $500m. There are mutterings that the company may go bankrupt.

It happened that his review was reechoed by the users of the car with less platform.

And where is MKBHD today, surprisingly, he is still a free man with the right to call any product crap with his reasons in so far as he bought it and is sharing his honest perspective as a user.

Nigerians are struggling to relate to this because if MKBHD was in Nigeria, he will be arrested first and fellow citizens will defend it because MKBHD does not know what it takes to build a business.

*********************
Note: The car company lied about some features that are not there. An integrity issue. They also sold a product that was not ready not minding the risks this poses for their customers. Nigerians want to wait until people died before they do Quality Assurance.

"""You'll be fine""

No, you won't. And that's a ridiculous statement. I can't really talk about safety, cause I don't know anything about it, so I'll just stick to common sense: cars are heavy as fuck. The difference between this and a regular car panel will be negligible when you're talking in terms on tonnes. The inside bits, the actual structure of the car, matters more. And I'll leave that to NCAP tests etc. Stainless steel changes nothing.

And when it comes to fender bender... well, again; the difference will be negligible when you're talking in terms on tonnes. Any collision that would result in a dent on a normal car will dent this. The only pro is that it isn't painted, but that's not actually a pro, cause it will rust... It won't even be worth its weight in scrap 10 years from now. And who know how much they're gonna sell spare panels for.

And this may be an unpopular opinion (j/k), but something COSTING $60.000 SHOULD NOT HAVE AN OPEN BETA! It's not a video game, it's the real world. Ridiculous.

"That thing looks like an Aliexpress novelty PC case made from recycled scrap metal. Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal.

"Dude I like you and I like your work. But that truck. Eh. I encountered one in real life recently in a parking lot. I really didn't like what I was seeing. The angles on this thing are dangerous to peds, cyclists, and smaller vehicles. I cannot get past the potential dangerousness of it to enjoy it otherwise. It's not only this truck. But the trend amongst makers of mid/large SUV'S and trucks to have these blunted (vs sloping front ends) making them appear more like large tractor trailer trucks is ridiculous. I have a Jeep and a Miata (that was rear ended today by a Chevy truck with this design) and in the two seater, drivers of these vehicles bear down very aggressively with their lights blinding me. My partner and I have had several rear and side enders with these trucks. She was driving today when it happened. I spoke with a coworker who had a similar vehicle and rides motorcycles and he emphatically voiced the same concerns. We both love two and four wheeled vehicles but the C.T. is is flat out dangerous to others. This thing is worse because it literally has no front bumper. I don't see how it even passed safety standards. Or where they made to go away to please E.M.","dude, like, like, work, truck, eh, encountered, one, real, life, recently, parking, lot, really, didnt, like, seeing, angle, thing, dangerous, peds, cyclist, smaller, vehicle, get, past, potential, dangerousness, enjoy, otherwise, truck, trend, amongst, maker, midlarge, suv, truck, blunted, v, sloping, front, end, making, appear, like, large, tractor, trailer, truck, ridiculous, jeep, miata, rear, ended, today, chevy, truck, design, two, seater, driver, vehicle, bear, aggressively, light, blinding, partner, several, rear, side, enders, truck, driving, today, happened, spoke, coworker, similar, vehicle, ride, motorcycle, emphatically, voiced, concern, love, two, four, wheeled, vehicle, ct, flat, dangerous, others, thing, worse, literally, front, bumper, dont, see, even, passed, safety, standard, made, go, away, please, em"

"I remember the New Beetle from the early 2000's had a similar effect as the PT Cruiser around the same time. We were all familiar with the old VW Beetle, its an automotive icon. Then this new car comes out, especially as cars in the 90s had gone through the 'melted cheese' design era of soft curves, and sloping shoulder lines. The New Beetle was round, but it was geometric. It was upright and tall for a small car, headroom like this was unheard of in a compact. Once they hit mass production, they were just another car on the road, but seeing them at first release was a cool sight, kind of like the Cybertruck now.","remember, new, beetle, early, similar, effect, pt, cruiser, around, time, familiar, old, vw, beetle, automotive, icon, new, car, come, especially, car, gone, melted, cheese, design, era, soft, curve, sloping, shoulder, line, new, beetle, round, geometric, upright, tall, small, car, headroom, like, unheard, compact, hit, mass, production, another, car, road, seeing, first, release, cool, sight, kind, like, cybertruck"

"Weather or not a truck is any good depends on how you intend to use it. To me, it's just another tool. I want the most practical truck for my construction business. I don't give a damn about how it looks. Definitely not a fan of Tesla's sloped bed sides - would make putting anything over the side or getting something out of the front of the bed an extreme annoyance and would really piss me off.  If I can't put a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood on the floor of the bed and close the tailgate - useless for my purposes. I punctured a gas tank on a F150 on a rough site - the replacement was about $1,935. To replace the Tesla battery back itself with all modules in it would be around $16,000.  A windshield for a Ford F150 will cost about $700. while the Cybertruck retails for $1,900.  I know it's because of the electronics in the Tesla glass but how do those electronics help my carpenters put more money in my pocket? Now we also have to factor in insurance costs. Insurance companies are steadily raising their rate for EV's because of the ridiculous repair costs. Let's face it, the Tesla truck doesn't seem like it's going to be a long term player in the construction business. More like a novelty item for those that would use it for anything other than your run of the mill pickup.","weather, truck, good, depends, intend, use, another, tool, want, practical, truck, construction, business, dont, give, damn, look, definitely, fan, tesla, sloped, bed, side, would, make, putting, anything, side, getting, something, front, bed, extreme, annoyance, would, really, piss, cant, put, x, sheet, plywood, floor, bed, close, tailgate, useless, purpose, punctured, gas, tank, f, rough, site, replacement, replace, tesla, battery, back, module, would, around, windshield, ford, f, cost, cybertruck, retail, know, electronics, tesla, glass, electronics, help, carpenter, put, money, pocket, also, factor, insurance, cost, insurance, company, steadily, raising, rate, ev, ridiculous, repair, cost, let, face, tesla, truck, doesnt, seem, like, going, long, term, player, construction, business, like, novelty, item, would, use, anything, run, mill, pickup"

"As a full-size truck owner for the majority of my life, I can honestly say people buy big trucks for one overwhelmingly simple reason:  They're comfortable.  They're not some tiny thing with a harsh, uncomfortable ride, a cramped, claustrophobic interior, little to no headroom, and only space enough for a lunch box or two in the trunk.  Full-size trucks have a very smooth ride, they're quiet, there's plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, and if/when you need to haul or tow something, you've got that covered.  They're also extremely heavily built and thus pretty safe for those traveling within.  They've also come a long way in terms of design and environmental creature comforts.  They're just better in every way than they used to be 20-30 years ago.  They're also extremely reliable and will last a very, very long time. 

So, yeah, you can get a Raptor or a TRX if you've got the cash, and they're very capable of doing amazing things off road, but they probably never will.  They just look amazing, so people want them, and that's fine.  You don't have to need to haul or tow something in order to justify owning a truck that can do those things.  If you want a vehicle that's safe, comfortable (even luxurious in some trims), and more capable than most things on the road, you buy a full-size truck.  

The Tesla Model X has been gliding silently through my dreams for years now, and I would dearly love to have one.  The Cybertruck?  I actually like the design, but I don't like that they shrank it so much from the prototype.  I'm sure that won't change, but it'll be interesting to see what does change in the future as these things continue to be mass produced and evolve.","fullsize, truck, owner, majority, life, honestly, say, people, buy, big, truck, one, overwhelmingly, simple, reason, theyre, comfortable, theyre, tiny, thing, harsh, uncomfortable, ride, cramped, claustrophobic, interior, little, headroom, space, enough, lunch, box, two, trunk, fullsize, truck, smooth, ride, theyre, quiet, there, plenty, room, everyone, comfortable, ifwhen, need, haul, tow, something, youve, got, covered, theyre, also, extremely, heavily, built, thus, pretty, safe, traveling, within, theyve, also, come, long, way, term, design, environmental, creature, comfort, theyre, better, every, way, used, year, ago, theyre, also, extremely, reliable, last, long, time, yeah, get, raptor, trx, youve, got, cash, theyre, capable, amazing, thing, road, probably, never, look, amazing, people, want, thats, fine, dont, need, haul, tow, something, order, justify, owning, truck, thing, want, vehicle, thats, safe, comfortable, even, luxurious, trim, capable, thing, road, buy, fullsize, truck, tesla, model, x, gliding, silently, dream, year, would, dearly, love, one, cybertruck, actually, like, design, dont, like, shrank, much, prototype, im, sure, wont, change, itll, interesting, see, change, future, thing, continue, mass, produced, evolve"

"Back in the 70s and 80s a major criticism of North American cars was the over focus on style, while ignoring how a vehicle did its job.

So cars were larger than they needed to be in order to accomplish their purpose. Thus the move from 70s boats to smaller 80s cars with similar interior space,  better build quality, and higher efficiency.

Basically, what I'm saying is that the Cybertruck is the equivalent of a 1976 Cadillac convertible with horns on the hood (check out Boss Hogg's Cadillac in The Dukes of Hazzard).

It's all about style, with no attention paid to functionality. It's a joke. 

By contrast, the typical truck is a testament to form following function.

And the whole acceleration thing is massively overblown. While every car guy/girl loves speed and power, you're talking about performance you can't use, but which will drain the battery even faster.

Which brings me to the question of environmental concerns.

How is a truck that is grossly overweight, has limited cargo space and capacity relative to similarly sized real trucks, and is shaped like a building in any way environmentally responsible?

It's laughable.

Is it a technical tour de force? Yes. But anyone trying to argue that there's any rational basis for buying this thing is kidding themselves. It's the equivalent of saying a Mustang is a legitimate family car because it has vestigial rear seats.

The Cybertruck is a ""pickup"", but only in the loosest sense.","back, major, criticism, north, american, car, focus, style, ignoring, vehicle, job, car, larger, needed, order, accomplish, purpose, thus, move, boat, smaller, car, similar, interior, space, better, build, quality, higher, efficiency, basically, im, saying, cybertruck, equivalent, cadillac, convertible, horn, hood, check, bos, hogg, cadillac, duke, hazzard, style, attention, paid, functionality, joke, contrast, typical, truck, testament, form, following, function, whole, acceleration, thing, massively, overblown, every, car, guygirl, love, speed, power, youre, talking, performance, cant, use, drain, battery, even, faster, brings, question, environmental, concern, truck, grossly, overweight, limited, cargo, space, capacity, relative, similarly, sized, real, truck, shaped, like, building, way, environmentally, responsible, laughable, technical, tour, de, force, yes, anyone, trying, argue, there, rational, basis, buying, thing, kidding, equivalent, saying, mustang, legitimate, family, car, vestigial, rear, seat, cybertruck, pickup, loosest, sense"

"That was an interesting chart (How F150 owners use their truck).  Here's one other consideration, when you need to tow something substantial, you REALLY need a truck.  You can't rent a truck unless you sign an agreement that you won't tow anything.  So while only 7% of F-150 owners use their truck for towing, there is no other option.  As far as personal hauling, it's the same thing.  Making renovations to your house?  You need something that can haul a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood, drywall, etc.. I did that with a 20 year old Honda Pilot, a full size SUV, but most SUVs now are too small.
So for occasional use the Cybertruck that rides like a nice car is cheaper on fuel than any ICE, roomier than most vehicles and will eventually be reasonably priced, why would you want anything else?  
Here's why not!  It doesn't have that much range.  If Tesla would have kept their promise of close to 500 miles of range then you would get 200 miles of range while towing in the winter, (loose 50% for towing 10,000 lb holiday trailer and another 10% for winter driving).

"You will *not* be fine if you're hit, either by or in this vehicle. Bulletproof stainless steel? There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago, and that's cuz during a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. That's why the hood and trunk of a car is made of aluminum. So that in the event of a crash it'll absorb the impact first instead of the human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.

Of course, this does come with a downside. You get into a minor crash nowadays, and your car's almost guaranteed to be totaled. But that's also the point. You want the car to crumple around the humans as much as possible so the human doesn't die. It's like that one high school project some kids do where you have to drop an egg in a basket from a roof without having the egg crack by wrapping it in soft stuff like toilet paper. You know what'll happen if you put the egg in a stainless steel bottle then drop it from the roof? That egg's exploding. 


When cars were made of steel accidents at what would be considered low speeds today were still dangerous af. Nowadays you get into an accident at 60 MPH and unless you're unlucky or T-boned people are usually not too badly injured. This monstrosity? Bro hitting a wall at 30MPH will be the equivalent of you sprinting faster than Usain Bolt straight into a wall.

"I really hope this style of car building will never really catch on. Let's be honest it looks aweful. It is iconic due to it being so apparently ugly and so it stands out. 

In my eyes the attraction of road users isn't it's most dangerous part. Obviously the suv type cars are all more dangerous than regular road vehicles. 

It sits too high, gives false illusions of control. Weighs too much. What will happen if it rolls? Do the sharp pointy edges of the car hold up? Or do they simply crush under the weight of the entire battery and suspension system? And to get inside the car quickly in the event of an emergency, you have to wait an extra second to get into the car as it has no physical handles... A handle will always be faster. Nice having a bullet proof car. But when you are getting shot at, that extra second to get into the bulletproof, metal thing, will add up... 

It is a mixed bag. The designers put totally random american stereotypes on the table and said 'let's do it all in one car'. 

Then the manipulative and failure of marketing it in any factual or practical way hits the final nail in the coffin. See it as a delorean. Except the cybertruck doesn't have any real character. At least the delorean looked sharp, and was put together with lots of passion. They simply neede way more money. 

The cybertruck designers had all the money they wanted. Tesla doesn't need to target their audience. Their audience targets them. And then they come with such mixed piece of metal angled, so called 'simplicity' or 'minimalism'. Yet not having a problem with making their services overly complex. Hooking you up with all the usual tesla subscriptions to keep your seats heated. In a matter of speaking... 

Tesla has never really gotten close to the other older, minimalistic cars out there. I haven't seen a Tesla with soul or character. It's all hightech and standing out. That is in no way at all what makes a ferrari or mclaren the beauties they are. It's a hype. Nothing more. And in 30 years we will look back at it and maybe see why it was modest. But nobody will ever understand why it had to be made in the first place. As it has no purpose at all.

That is what it's lacking. Without purpose you lose all forms of character.","really, hope, style, car, building, never, really, catch, let, honest, look, aweful, iconic, due, apparently, ugly, stand, eye, attraction, road, user, isnt, dangerous, part, obviously, suv, type, car, dangerous, regular, road, vehicle, sits, high, give, false, illusion, control, weighs, much, happen, roll, sharp, pointy, edge, car, hold, simply, crush, weight, entire, battery, suspension, system, get, inside, car, quickly, event, emergency, wait, extra, second, get, car, physical, handle, handle, always, faster, nice, bullet, proof, car, getting, shot, extra, second, get, bulletproof, metal, thing, add, mixed, bag, designer, put, totally, random, american, stereotype, table, said, let, one, car, manipulative, failure, marketing, factual, practical, way, hit, final, nail, coffin, see, delorean, except, cybertruck, doesnt, real, character, least, delorean, looked, sharp, put, together, lot, passion, simply, neede, way, money, cybertruck, designer, money, wanted, tesla, doesnt, need, target, audience, audience, target, come, mixed, piece, metal, angled, called, simplicity, minimalism, yet, problem, making, service, overly, complex, hooking, usual, tesla, subscription, keep, seat, heated, matter, speaking, tesla, never, really, gotten, close, older, minimalistic, car, havent, seen, tesla, soul, character, hightech, standing, way, make, ferrari, mclaren, beauty, hype, nothing, year, look, back, maybe, see, modest, nobody, ever, understand, made, first, place, purpose, lacking, without, purpose, lose, form, character"

Of course most of that can, in most cases, also be controlled thru the touch screen or like on my Tesla via stalks.   Also the left scroll wheel allows changing the driver display on my MS to one of a few on the right or left side of the display. Just some examples.

"Marques, I think this was the best video you've ever made. And for all the right reasons. It had nothing to do with Tesla and all to do with you and your crew's genius filmmaking ability: everything came together (script, camera work, editing, tempo, delivery, technical due dilligence) in such a near-perfect way that surely makes this video iconic, and uncontroversially so. It's a bold claim, but I've been a fan of you for enough years to feel confident to say that. So, really, huge props to you.

And, now, addressing the discussion you proposed about the ""iconicity"" of the Cybertruck (and of cars in general) at the last portion of the video, I'll say that I agree that the Cybertruck is already an iconic car, but I don't think that it being mass-produced is gonna make it any less iconic, necessarily. I avow to that because I come from a country, Brazil, in which two of the most iconic cars to the general public were also the most popular vehicles on the streets for a very long time. Those were the VW Beetle and VW Kombi (Station Wagon). Now, of course, that logic, as you suggested, might be very different when it comes to the US, and I'm not knowledgeable enough in US popular culture to know if there may be any iconic mass-produced cars there, as there are here in Brazil. However, I put this perspective forward because I truly think that the Cybertruck might as well be forever iconic, no matter how many units end up being produced. Maybe, like in Brazil (and, potentially, like in other places around the world), it being mass produced might make it even more iconic over time!

Aaaaaand that's about it. Again, I'm overjoyed to have seen you've produced such a masterpiece. You deserve it so much, you're constantly improving in your craft. It's always a pleasure watching you, but this one was special. It's a cause for celebration for MKBHD fans that, for its part, must never be underrated. Cheers!","marque, think, best, video, youve, ever, made, right, reason, nothing, tesla, crew, genius, filmmaking, ability, everything, came, together, script, camera, work, editing, tempo, delivery, technical, due, dilligence, nearperfect, way, surely, make, video, iconic, uncontroversially, bold, claim, ive, fan, enough, year, feel, confident, say, really, huge, prop, addressing, discussion, proposed, iconicity, cybertruck, car, general, last, portion, video, ill, say, agree, cybertruck, already, iconic, car, dont, think, massproduced, gon, na, make, le, iconic, necessarily, avow, come, country, brazil, two, iconic, car, general, public, also, popular, vehicle, street, long, time, vw, beetle, vw, kombi, station, wagon, course, logic, suggested, might, different, come, u, im, knowledgeable, enough, u, popular, culture, know, may, iconic, massproduced, car, brazil, however, put, perspective, forward, truly, think, cybertruck, might, well, forever, iconic, matter, many, unit, end, produced, maybe, like, brazil, potentially, like, place, around, world, mass, produced, might, make, even, iconic, time, aaaaaand, thats, im, overjoyed, seen, youve, produced, masterpiece, deserve, much, youre, constantly, improving, craft, always, pleasure, watching, one, special, cause, celebration, mkbhd, fan, part, must, never, underrated, cheer"

"Dont know man, this review is a little funny to me. I am upfront i am no musk fan so more than likely to look at this negative bias. Still, a couple of concerns stuck out to me:

1) the issue with the car door: i accept initial production and such there are teething pain but why tape fix? Is there an issue taking it to service to fix? Why only a comment on twitter about it? 
2) the race, i am sorry, what tesla is doin is deceiving pure and simple. Most basic 911, not even the full race shown, selective data of the full race afterwards with no comparisons.
3) you claim on hand it is a regular tesla under the truck guise, yet you admit it lacks a few  the same features so it isnt a full tesla under there. Why arent the same features available? Was it rushed out? Shouldnt it be feature complere even if it is early models?Should it be the same under the hood? Domt trucks have specific needs that cars dont need different software and such?
4) you seem to gloss over issues like towing and the matter of the missing features due people having other priorities. However what about the people that it is a priority, what id you need the features when you did not think you need it? Even if it is not a priority why settle for lesser when others have it better or as standard?
5) the lack of handles. Wasnt there an issue with the door being frozen shut in cold weather? Was that resovled? How do you access the car otherwise?
6) no physical controls or buttons/all controls in one screen- what do you do if that tablet is broken or doesnt fuction properly? How many features or functions do you lose? Can you drive without it both physically and without readouts like a speedometer? 
I am trying to keep an open mind about this so if there are reasonable answers i am happy to here them.","dont, know, man, review, little, funny, upfront, musk, fan, likely, look, negative, bias, still, couple, concern, stuck, issue, car, door, accept, initial, production, teething, pain, tape, fix, issue, taking, service, fix, comment, twitter, race, sorry, tesla, doin, deceiving, pure, simple, basic, even, full, race, shown, selective, data, full, race, afterwards, comparison, claim, hand, regular, tesla, truck, guise, yet, admit, lack, feature, isnt, full, tesla, arent, feature, available, rushed, shouldnt, feature, complere, even, early, modelsshould, hood, domt, truck, specific, need, car, dont, need, different, software, seem, gloss, issue, like, towing, matter, missing, feature, due, people, priority, however, people, priority, id, need, feature, think, need, even, priority, settle, lesser, others, better, standard, lack, handle, wasnt, issue, door, frozen, shut, cold, weather, resovled, access, car, otherwise, physical, control, buttonsall, control, one, screen, tablet, broken, doesnt, fuction, properly, many, feature, function, lose, drive, without, physically, without, readout, like, speedometer, trying, keep, open, mind, reasonable, answer, happy"

"This Cybertruck is DA BOMB !!!! It is one of THE COOLEST vehicles OF ANY KIND out there! AND it actually IS a great WORKING truck! The bed length is good. You can fit lots of stuff in it! It carries 2500 lbs in the bed which 300 lbs for than a typical Ford F150 Truck. It can two 11,000 lbs which is one thousand pounds MORE than the F150 Lightning!  The audio system IS ASTOUNDING in its audio-purist-laden sound quality! The inside is minimalist and simple, allowing for easy cleaning!

EVERYTHING about this truck screams both PURE TRUCK ABILITY and pure awesomeness!

This is just the START of good thinks to come into the Tesla Cybertruck world! Wait until Tesla puts in the massaging seats, the built-in combo-fridge/freezer, the built-in Nespresso coffee maker and the built-in combo-microwave/convection oven AND add the 100,000 lumens lightbar and 360-degree surround-view FLIR thermal nightvision system!  It will be a monster of pure truck luxury and towing/carrying ability!

This truck GROWS on you the more you drive it and more you use it AS an actual truck (i.e. carry and tow stuff!).

In five years we won't be having this type of conversation anymore. It will instead be: Can hit 1500 miles range on a single charge? and Can other truck companies compete with it in the market place?

The Cybertruck is A LOT BETTER THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE! No other vehicle has hit more home runs right out of the starting gate than any other vehicle.  The driving range issue will be SOLVED within two years! The Self-driving software WILL be coming by 2025! All the other 3rd party add-ons and extras will ALSO be coming down the pipeline as we speak! Look already how many AWESOME Vinyl Wraps we can get for the Cybertruck! Matte, Glossy, Full Colour Images, Cammo Patterns and even the colour changing ones you see on modern phone cases! It's GREAT!

Keep Going Tesla! This is a WINNING PRODUCT and just needs more factory support and driving range increases!

"I got a longbed truck and tow stuff with it all the time. I tow my cargo trailer. I tore down a house and towed it to the landfill. I use it to carry my big kayak. And I scrap metal too. I hate seeing people with trucks that don't use them. They take up space, cause a ton of pollution, and are very dangerous to pedestrians. Most people only need sedans. Because even sedans are a waste of space, most people don't care anything more than a backpack and the other 4 seats are wasted too. But that's another issue, American cities are designed to force you to drive. All that most people need though is a car. If they need furniture, paying one time delivery fee or renting a uhaul truck would save thousands of dollars compared to buying a whole truck to use just once a year. Even if you do haul a lot of stuff, a pickup is still not the best.

4:10 wait so no force feedbacküò¨,"wait, force, feedback"
"What I love : 1) Steer by wire system that changes its ratio based on the speed. 
2) 800 Volt High voltage architecture with the newer cells, 400 and 800 Volt charging, and 48 volt low voltage architecture. (Bless you for pushing the industry in the right direction)
3) Wade mode.
4) Off road mode. (I guess that should be a default feature for every truck)
5) 4 wheel steering.
What I don't care about : 1) Bulletproof (Meh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ, I like guns, but I don't think I'll be gunned down while driving anytime. And, its not that bulletproof either)
2) Steel body invincibility hype. (There are plastic portions on the bottom, is that still invincible?)
3) Speed and acceleration. (This isn't the model s, that should have been model s's selling point)
     Honestly, why didn't they create a drive train similar to the Tesla semi?, it would have given it the acceleration that they so love, plus, give it the range that we require from a truck.
What I hate : 1) Ugly shape (The same approximate shape could have been remodeled to look better, but this exact shape is just 
ü§Æ. To mkbhd: The reason why people said it looks alien, is because they are trying to find words that do not make you feel bad about your purchase)
2) Towing range. (This is a truck, right?, why didn't they approach the design like they did for the semi?, they purposely changed the drive train for the semi to improve range, they could have done something similar here, then why not? just so that the one's who want to drive trucks like cars get what they want?, that's stupid, a truck needs to be a truck, everything else is an add on)
3) I love the minimalist interior design, BUT, and a big BUT, I WANT the gear change and turn signals to be physical stalks. I can easily imagine minimalist designs for stalks, example stalks with haptic feedback, and cybertruck'esk style sharply curved stalks, they will look better and wouldn't require as much expensive hardware but still get the job done. Also, they just went back to the center horn, but I hated that feature as well, its borderline dangerous, horn needs to be on the center of the wheel, no compromise.","love, steer, wire, system, change, ratio, based, speed, volt, high, voltage, architecture, newer, cell, volt, charging, volt, low, voltage, architecture, bless, pushing, industry, right, direction, wade, mode, road, mode, guess, default, feature, every, truck, wheel, steering, dont, care, bulletproof, meh, like, gun, dont, think, ill, gunned, driving, anytime, bulletproof, either, steel, body, invincibility, hype, plastic, portion, bottom, still, invincible, speed, acceleration, isnt, model, model, s, selling, point, honestly, didnt, create, drive, train, similar, tesla, semi, would, given, acceleration, love, plus, give, range, require, truck, hate, ugly, shape, approximate, shape, could, remodeled, look, better, exact, shape, mkbhd, reason, people, said, look, alien, trying, find, word, make, feel, bad, purchase, towing, range, truck, right, didnt, approach, design, like, semi, purposely, changed, drive, train, semi, improve, range, could, done, something, similar, one, want, drive, truck, like, car, get, want, thats, stupid, truck, need, truck, everything, else, add, love, minimalist, interior, design, big, want, gear, change, turn, signal, physical, stalk, easily, imagine, minimalist, design, stalk, example, stalk, haptic, feedback, cybertruckesk, style, sharply, curved, stalk, look, better, wouldnt, require, much, expensive, hardware, still, get, job, done, also, went, back, center, horn, hated, feature, well, borderline, dangerous, horn, need, center, wheel, compromise"

"I'm sorry but I feel like the whole video was just gaslighting people to make them think cybertruck is really awesome. ""It's just a drag race. No big deal"" is one of the most gaslighting thing I have ever heard. I'm a car and bike enthusiast and I frankly admit the defeat of the ICE cars and trucks when it comes to acceleration compared to EVs and I do realise that EVs are going to be the future. But that doesn't mean you can misinterpret an actual fact just so that you can look cool and make people buy your products. ""This is going to be just like other SUVs and that's fine"" - No it's not. SUVs are such a big problem on the roads. And with a design and material like this on the road, good luck anyone getting hit by these even at the lower speeds. This exists with ICE SUVs too. And that's the point. My respect for MKBHD has gone to the depths. ""Everything we love about Tesla and the other things that comes with it"", why not say everything we hate about Tesla as well?

"Brother,
This was a Fun & clever video covering many of the media fud and facts. üòé 
As for me, I love the CyberTruck, its futuristic looks, super innovations, and stunning performance. I say this in spite of loving sports cars, and having owned two 911's and other sporty cars. 

You're so RIGHT about the rear view mirror major miss (perhaps a gov't overlord issue), and the towing was a massive miss in spite of the irrelevant 6% factoid when considered a pick-up truck. We by a pick up so we can anything needed, if we need!  I've used my RAM 1500's to tow my boats and campers ... Tesla's use of that 6% factoid is not well thought out and more a defensive posture because battery capacity has not progressed adequately to support the 500+ mile range.  Perhaps the biggest letdown of the entire CyberTruck release!  I still hold hope they will soon resolve this with improved 4680 or other developments.

My take on the Stainless finger print issue... it is silly, but admittedly also why I no longer consider black cars, and which I'd say are worse for Dirt and Fingerprints than the Stainless CyberTruck. Stainless is a uniquely benefit for Tesla! This because Tesla/SpaceX Stainless cost benefits for a truck and I am a massive fan.  Sharing with SpaceX Starship vehicle massively is unique in bring costs down... once the ""big brain engineers"" designed the ""machine that builds the machine!""  Both vehicles are made from an austenitic stainless steel alloy called ""Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel"" for its high strength and Corrosion Resistance.
I believe it's also a showcases for the versatility of this particular stainless steel alloy... which may be considered for a future RoboTaxi and this heavy-duty CyberTruck pickup.

- What about the nefarious planned obsolescence that is behind this kind of cars?

- What about safety while you have an accident, both while driving this and for people that collide with it? 

- What about firefighters taking you out of this truck? in my understanding, the less resistant the material of a car is, the more chances you have of surviving.

- What about the right to repair these cars? you kind of always miss that part in your Tesla reviews.

- How will this truck hold up in the future to maintain it, since all Teslas depend on software updates, screens and sensors?

- What about the environmental issues that this kind of tech causes (I talk about screen-wise and materials to create it)? Lets not forget that although electric bateries aren't gas, they still are reaaally hard to recycle.

And the fact that Marques just glances over these things and presents this monstrosity in a positive light going so far as to say him and his team will be using it on the daily also speaks volumes to his bias.

"Marques, you're a really cool dude, and a great honest guy - and happy Easter, by the way . . . but there are two things that I don't understand from your presentation:

1. The idea that Tesla's new stamping process will ensure better fit and finish as Tesla Giga Texas gears up . . . to what I think you mean is full series production, and secondly,

2. The idea that it is overrated as a towing vehicle.

Unless the method of dealing with the 1.8 mm and 1.4 mm special order  stainless steel from Finland has changed s8nce Sandy Monroe got a tour with the engibeers and head of department around the time of delivery day -- then they are expressly not using stamping, but rather laser cutting and an air braked bending (to avoid bruising the exterior surface). There was an experiences production engineer speculsting on YT prior to the release that laser cutting and bending would conventionally limit (any other manufacturer) to 50,000 vehicles per year; it just takes too long compared with stamping. At least for anyone else. Of course, Tesla engineers may already have a weekly run rate proving me wrong here. But the point is that the fine tolerances demanded for the process they have chosen, this probably requires fit and finish problems to be ironed out very early, much ealier than you imagined. But - conventionally - at something like 3rd quarter 2024 Tesla hits the wall and has to decide if it can push the bending process, or if they have to start again with an actual stamping process. And remember, the new process was set up to cope with 3 mm stainless steel sheet.

The second thing was that are you meaning that all EV pickup trucks fail as towing vehicles. In the setting of a video production company working almost wholly in an urban setting, and without crazy deadines . . . I would have thought it could have been really goog. In terms of the feel of the trailer in relation to available power, and leveling and suspension generally. Also, the fact that you have the cover over the back. You can go to lunch an the fact that you have super expensive gear that can't be seen  together with sentry mode, even the foldup back seats, it all goes to make up a reall superior package - when you are hauling anything in a day of shooting.. I don't know. I've got to go to look at the Out of Spec Review of all the cutrent EV trucks towing trailers with a caf ontop - oer the Rockies.

"TLDR: Tesla's business model is simply not sustainable due entirely to Musk's petulant behaviour. 

We all know that Marques doesn't pay for his own tech or toys, but videos like this burn me up because it seems like he is saying, ""ah shit, well I need a new video to bump up views again...might as well praise something that is getting universally negative reception.""

The Cybertruck, at the end of all things, yet another overpromised and underdelivered ridiculous machine, created by and for aging techbros who have far too much disposable income for their own good, but cannot curb their narcissism. 

The entire reason that Tesla is staying afloat right now is because of Model 3 and Model Y, that's literally it. Every single other thing they do is eating them alive and has caused massive negative trends in their value... Not to mention their owner right now is the king of bigotry and stupidity who has made it his sole mission in life to become the main character of the planet as he reminds all of us on a daily basis that he is going through a midlife crisis.

Admittedly Tesla nailed a lot of things when it comes to EV's, but their time is sunsetting now with the rise of other companies going at it. The Cybertruck I feel marks either their downward trend into a nich√© product, OR them having to fully oust Musk and entirely rework their image.","tldr, tesla, business, model, simply, sustainable, due, entirely, musk, petulant, behaviour, know, marque, doesnt, pay, tech, toy, video, like, burn, seems, like, saying, ah, shit, well, need, new, video, bump, view, againmight, well, praise, something, getting, universally, negative, reception, cybertruck, end, thing, yet, another, overpromised, underdelivered, ridiculous, machine, created, aging, techbros, far, much, disposable, income, good, curb, narcissism, entire, reason, tesla, staying, afloat, right, model, model, thats, literally, every, single, thing, eating, alive, caused, massive, negative, trend, value, mention, owner, right, king, bigotry, stupidity, made, sole, mission, life, become, main, character, planet, reminds, u, daily, basis, going, midlife, crisis, admittedly, tesla, nailed, lot, thing, come, ev, time, sunsetting, rise, company, going, cybertruck, feel, mark, either, downward, trend, nich, product, fully, oust, musk, entirely, rework, image"

He promised that the chassis would be one piece, but it isnt and is made like normal other cars. The interior is very bad and cheaply made. There are no phsical buttons on the dashboard so you have to do everything through the display, which causes you to not pay attention to the road in front of you. Also, the front of the car is angled in a way that if you hit some pedestrian with it, the pedestrian goes under the car instead of over the car and over the roof. It is a dangerous thing. Also, it has near zero crumple zones so if you hit someone, your car stays in the same shape. This is a problem because first, when you hit a normal car, the car will be shredded no matter what. second of all, if you hit another cybertruck, both drivers will be dead because both cars will stop instantly without any gradual slowing down. Also, this car rusts af, the panels are not aligned so if you hit someone with the side of your truck, you literally cut them like a sausage.

"You are on good terms with Musk and I get that you don't want to jeopardize this relationship, but this video is obviously very biased.

I agree that it's an iconic car, yes. That being said, it's not iconic because it's rare, but because it's very different and, crucially, very controversial.

It's not a good car, if you look at it as a tool to get something done. As was pointed out, most people don't use trucks to do truck things, they drive them on paved roads in town. Now what's the problem with that?

1. It's heavy, big and tall. Maybe not as big as an F150, but the same problems are still there. It will absolutely annihilate pedestrians in a crash, especially due to the terrible design of many US roads. It will also kill people in other, normal cars, that could've survived if both parties drove similar vehicles. And it will wear out streets and increase maintenance cost much more than a lighter car.
In short, these types of vehicle are bad for everyone and everything except the person driving, and being fine with that is a bad attitude to have.

2. It is made from steel. The rain breaks it and it will corrode. This car is made for California and Texas, but live in a colder, rainy or humid area and it will not survive being outside for extended periods of time.
Or you could buy the extra coating for a few thousand bucks to make it corrosion resistant. What the heck.

3. Normal people don't care for fast acceleration. It's dangerous in real world road situations and makes people behave like douchebags.

All of that brings me to the conclusion that it is a bad car. It's a good status symbol, if you need this for your ego, but it sucks for everyone else on the road.
If you want a car that's good at doing stuff a truck was initially intended to accomplish and that fits actual, real use cases, get a Mitsubishi Fuso Canter.","good, term, musk, get, dont, want, jeopardize, relationship, video, obviously, biased, agree, iconic, car, yes, said, iconic, rare, different, crucially, controversial, good, car, look, tool, get, something, done, pointed, people, dont, use, truck, truck, thing, drive, paved, road, town, whats, problem, heavy, big, tall, maybe, big, f, problem, still, absolutely, annihilate, pedestrian, crash, especially, due, terrible, design, many, u, road, also, kill, people, normal, car, couldve, survived, party, drove, similar, vehicle, wear, street, increase, maintenance, cost, much, lighter, car, short, type, vehicle, bad, everyone, everything, except, person, driving, fine, bad, attitude, made, steel, rain, break, corrode, car, made, california, texas, live, colder, rainy, humid, area, survive, outside, extended, period, time, could, buy, extra, coating, thousand, buck, make, corrosion, resistant, heck, normal, people, dont, care, fast, acceleration, dangerous, real, world, road, situation, make, people, behave, like, douchebags, brings, conclusion, bad, car, good, status, symbol, need, ego, suck, everyone, else, road, want, car, thats, good, stuff, truck, initially, intended, accomplish, fit, actual, real, use, case, get, mitsubishi, fuso, canter"

There's a term called 'crumple zone' that describes a vehicle's ability to deform in order to absorb shocks and minimise the impact towards the people in the car. The 'tougher' the outside of the car is, the more it amplifies the impact force on the people inside.
That's why car makers have been making panels from light and thin materials for decades and it's been proven to be the safest way to build a car.

"""A physical button is button, in a lot of ways, is better than a digital button"" - what?

I am pretty sure most buttons in cars are both physical and digital. i.e. they are physical in the sense they are not touch based but also digital in the sense they do not actually control the component directly in an analog manner.

If you press the ""increase fan speed"" button in a regular car, it does not directly affect the fan motor. Instead it sends a digital signal to some controller that interprets it.


Anyways I assume he meant to say people prefer physical buttons to touch-sensitive surfaces/buttons.","physical, button, button, lot, way, better, digital, button, pretty, sure, button, car, physical, digital, ie, physical, sense, touch, based, also, digital, sense, actually, control, component, directly, analog, manner, press, increase, fan, speed, button, regular, car, directly, affect, fan, motor, instead, sends, digital, signal, controller, interprets, anyways, assume, meant, say, people, prefer, physical, button, touchsensitive, surfacesbuttons"

And why would you use a sledge hammer on that truck?!  Stainless steel can still scratch.

As far as comparing it to the PT Cruiser, not a great comparison. That was a quick cash grab using a Neon platform and offering little, if anything innovative.

"The thing that people need to remember, as with so many other things... if you get attention on social media, it doesn't mean you're doing something good. People just think that taking a photo of what you're driving/wearing/saying/singing.... will generate some good content on their own social media. To mock it or praise it, it doesn't matter. Or even praise something they don't like, because it's good for traffic. The ugliest car and the nicest car in the world would have an equal amount of attention and people taking photos. That differentiation is gone, compared to the pre social media era. Same goes for people doing bad things or making mistakes. If you had an DUI or crashed into something or someone, you used to feel ashamed and only tell a few people. Now people go live instantly, trying to apologize or start vlogging their ""mental recovery to inspire others"". And drop links to their merchandize, of course.

People will  indeed stop next to your Cybertruck and go nuts... not because they extremely like the car, but because it's a celebrity car they saw on Youtube and see it first time in the flesh.

"So, It is neither a truck or cyber.....what it really is a metal coffin. If you get in a serious accident in this metal box, the chances of you surviving is virtually Zero. There is a reason why we don't build cars out of stainless steel. Since the 1950s at least, automakers have understood that stiffer cars are more dangerous to people inside and outside the car because in a crash they deliver energy to other parties rather than absorbing it. In an early crash test experiments with more heavily built cars, collisions often did only minor damage to the car but turned the test dummies into paste. Since then, cars have been designed with progressively more sophisticated crumple zones to absorb impact forces. Musk‚Äôs boasts of a Cybertruck ‚Äúexoskeleton,‚Äù if true, are a recipe for gruesome carnage. It is hard to make curved shapes with stainless steel, so the truck both looks like a low-polygon video game asset from the PlayStation 1 and also has terrible aerodynamics. The large cab and goofy sloped back means the bed is so cramped it can‚Äôt even fit an ordinary bicycle.

we can conclude that the Cybertruck is just possibly the dumbest vehicle ever produced.","neither, truck, cyberwhat, really, metal, coffin, get, serious, accident, metal, box, chance, surviving, virtually, zero, reason, dont, build, car, stainless, steel, since, least, automaker, understood, stiffer, car, dangerous, people, inside, outside, car, crash, deliver, energy, party, rather, absorbing, early, crash, test, experiment, heavily, built, car, collision, often, minor, damage, car, turned, test, dummy, paste, since, car, designed, progressively, sophisticated, crumple, zone, absorb, impact, force, musk, boast, cybertruck, exoskeleton, true, recipe, gruesome, carnage, hard, make, curved, shape, stainless, steel, truck, look, like, lowpolygon, video, game, asset, playstation, also, terrible, aerodynamics, large, cab, goofy, sloped, back, mean, bed, cramped, even, fit, ordinary, bicycle, conclude, cybertruck, possibly, dumbest, vehicle, ever, produced"

"I ordered one back in 2019 when it was released.  I had high hopes.  The production model is overpriced garbage.  Tesla dropped the exoskeleton design and nerfed the rest of the design by skimping on the thickness of the stainless steel and other massive compromises such as shrinking it.  Then they doubled the price.  The people who bought this car initially were futurists.  The people buying the nerfed mini version are just attention seeking douchebags.  It was an easy choice for me to cancel my order.  A futuristic amazing vehicle reduced to a mass market fashion accessory for the ""look at me"" crowd.  No thanks.  The production model is ugly wavy refrigerator grade stainless steel and looks awkward due to the resizing.  Most of them are rusting already and the bed is not even water tight.  It's amazing that Tesla could screw up so badly.  Once the hype runs out on this vehicle like it has already with the Model 3 people will start dumping them.  The model 3 was selling for more used than it was new during the pandemic and now they are at least 1/2 off due to the hype dying.
