"Yeah Marques I'm gonna be honest I've been kinda falling out of love with your reviews the last few years and I think this was the final nail in the coffin. Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn't take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the ""most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck"" while speeding past it's more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it.

"Electric Car Company Loses over $500m after Customers Reviews.

A YouTuber, Marques Brownlee using the MKBHD handled reviewed an electric car called Fisker and on his YouTube channel, shared his damning observations of the car. 

He did this despite the car company asking him to wait for the software update that they said was coming to the vehicle.
 
According to MKBHD, he is reviewing it because the company had made the product public and was actually selling to customers.

Following his review where he called it the worst car he has ever reviewed, which had over 4 million views and other inefficiencies of the car company, Fisker has now recorded a net loss of over $500m. There are mutterings that the company may go bankrupt.

It happened that his review was reechoed by the users of the car with less platform.

And where is MKBHD today, surprisingly, he is still a free man with the right to call any product crap with his reasons in so far as he bought it and is sharing his honest perspective as a user.

Nigerians are struggling to relate to this because if MKBHD was in Nigeria, he will be arrested first and fellow citizens will defend it because MKBHD does not know what it takes to build a business.

*********************
Note: The car company lied about some features that are not there. An integrity issue. They also sold a product that was not ready not minding the risks this poses for their customers. Nigerians want to wait until people died before they do Quality Assurance.

"You will *not* be fine if you're hit, either by or in this vehicle. Bulletproof stainless steel? There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago, and that's cuz during a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. That's why the hood and trunk of a car is made of aluminum. So that in the event of a crash it'll absorb the impact first instead of the human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.

Of course, this does come with a downside. You get into a minor crash nowadays, and your car's almost guaranteed to be totaled. But that's also the point. You want the car to crumple around the humans as much as possible so the human doesn't die. It's like that one high school project some kids do where you have to drop an egg in a basket from a roof without having the egg crack by wrapping it in soft stuff like toilet paper. You know what'll happen if you put the egg in a stainless steel bottle then drop it from the roof? That egg's exploding. 


When cars were made of steel accidents at what would be considered low speeds today were still dangerous af. Nowadays you get into an accident at 60 MPH and unless you're unlucky or T-boned people are usually not too badly injured. This monstrosity? Bro hitting a wall at 30MPH will be the equivalent of you sprinting faster than Usain Bolt straight into a wall.

"Dont know man, this review is a little funny to me. I am upfront i am no musk fan so more than likely to look at this negative bias. Still, a couple of concerns stuck out to me:

1) the issue with the car door: i accept initial production and such there are teething pain but why tape fix? Is there an issue taking it to service to fix? Why only a comment on twitter about it? 
2) the race, i am sorry, what tesla is doin is deceiving pure and simple. Most basic 911, not even the full race shown, selective data of the full race afterwards with no comparisons.
3) you claim on hand it is a regular tesla under the truck guise, yet you admit it lacks a few  the same features so it isnt a full tesla under there. Why arent the same features available? Was it rushed out? Shouldnt it be feature complere even if it is early models?Should it be the same under the hood? Domt trucks have specific needs that cars dont need different software and such?
4) you seem to gloss over issues like towing and the matter of the missing features due people having other priorities. However what about the people that it is a priority, what id you need the features when you did not think you need it? Even if it is not a priority why settle for lesser when others have it better or as standard?
5) the lack of handles. Wasnt there an issue with the door being frozen shut in cold weather? Was that resovled? How do you access the car otherwise?
6) no physical controls or buttons/all controls in one screen- what do you do if that tablet is broken or doesnt fuction properly? How many features or functions do you lose? Can you drive without it both physically and without readouts like a speedometer? 
I am trying to keep an open mind about this so if there are reasonable answers i am happy to here them.","dont, know, man, review, little, funny, upfront, musk, fan, likely, look, negative, bias, still, couple, concern, stuck, issue, car, door, accept, initial, production, teething, pain, tape, fix, issue, taking, service, fix, comment, twitter, race, sorry, tesla, doin, deceiving, pure, simple, basic, even, full, race, shown, selective, data, full, race, afterwards, comparison, claim, hand, regular, tesla, truck, guise, yet, admit, lack, feature, isnt, full, tesla, arent, feature, available, rushed, shouldnt, feature, complere, even, early, modelsshould, hood, domt, truck, specific, need, car, dont, need, different, software, seem, gloss, issue, like, towing, matter, missing, feature, due, people, priority, however, people, priority, id, need, feature, think, need, even, priority, settle, lesser, others, better, standard, lack, handle, wasnt, issue, door, frozen, shut, cold, weather, resovled, access, car, otherwise, physical, control, buttonsall, control, one, screen, tablet, broken, doesnt, fuction, properly, many, feature, function, lose, drive, without, physically, without, readout, like, speedometer, trying, keep, open, mind, reasonable, answer, happy",Negative

"I got a longbed truck and tow stuff with it all the time. I tow my cargo trailer. I tore down a house and towed it to the landfill. I use it to carry my big kayak. And I scrap metal too. I hate seeing people with trucks that don't use them. They take up space, cause a ton of pollution, and are very dangerous to pedestrians. Most people only need sedans. Because even sedans are a waste of space, most people don't care anything more than a backpack and the other 4 seats are wasted too. But that's another issue, American cities are designed to force you to drive. All that most people need though is a car. If they need furniture, paying one time delivery fee or renting a uhaul truck would save thousands of dollars compared to buying a whole truck to use just once a year. Even if you do haul a lot of stuff, a pickup is still not the best. A cargo van has much more space and is lower to the ground, making loading easier, and it's kept secure, instead of having stuff in the open bed, and protects it from the elements.

And the fact that Marques just glances over these things and presents this monstrosity in a positive light going so far as to say him and his team will be using it on the daily also speaks volumes to his bias. If Tesla needed time to update their software and squash some release date bugs, MKB would've held out on the review 100%, something he didn't do for Fisker (and something I agree with ofc, which makes it all the more confusing how he could present this mess as a ""good car"").

We all know that Marques doesn't pay for his own tech or toys, but videos like this burn me up because it seems like he is saying, ""ah shit, well I need a new video to bump up views again...might as well praise something that is getting universally negative reception.""

The Cybertruck, at the end of all things, yet another overpromised and underdelivered ridiculous machine, created by and for aging techbros who have far too much disposable income for their own good, but cannot curb their narcissism. 

The entire reason that Tesla is staying afloat right now is because of Model 3 and Model Y, that's literally it. Every single other thing they do is eating them alive and has caused massive negative trends in their value... Not to mention their owner right now is the king of bigotry and stupidity who has made it his sole mission in life to become the main character of the planet as he reminds all of us on a daily basis that he is going through a midlife crisis.

Admittedly Tesla nailed a lot of things when it comes to EV's, but their time is sunsetting now with the rise of other companies going at it.

I agree that it's an iconic car, yes. That being said, it's not iconic because it's rare, but because it's very different and, crucially, very controversial.

It's not a good car, if you look at it as a tool to get something done. As was pointed out, most people don't use trucks to do truck things, they drive them on paved roads in town. Now what's the problem with that?

1. It's heavy, big and tall. Maybe not as big as an F150, but the same problems are still there. It will absolutely annihilate pedestrians in a crash, especially due to the terrible design of many US roads. It will also kill people in other, normal cars, that could've survived if both parties drove similar vehicles. And it will wear out streets and increase maintenance cost much more than a lighter car.
In short, these types of vehicle are bad for everyone and everything except the person driving, and being fine with that is a bad attitude to have.

2. It is made from steel. The rain breaks it and it will corrode. This car is made for California and Texas, but live in a colder, rainy or humid area and it will not survive being outside for extended periods of time.
Or you could buy the extra coating for a few thousand bucks to make it corrosion resistant. What the heck.

3. Normal people don't care for fast acceleration. It's dangerous in real world road situations and makes people behave like douchebags.

All of that brings me to the conclusion that it is a bad car. It's a good status symbol, if you need this for your ego, but it sucks for everyone else on the road.
If you want a car that's good at doing stuff a truck was initially intended to accomplish and that fits actual, real use cases, get a Mitsubishi Fuso Canter.","good, term, musk, get, dont, want, jeopardize, relationship, video, obviously, biased, agree, iconic, car, yes, said, iconic, rare, different, crucially, controversial, good, car, look, tool, get, something, done, pointed, people, dont, use, truck, truck, thing, drive, paved, road, town, whats, problem, heavy, big, tall, maybe, big, f, problem, still, absolutely, annihilate, pedestrian, crash, especially, due, terrible, design, many, u, road, also, kill, people, normal, car, couldve, survived, party, drove, similar, vehicle, wear, street, increase, maintenance, cost, much, lighter, car, short, type, vehicle, bad, everyone, everything, except, person, driving, fine, bad, attitude, made, steel, rain, break, corrode, car, made, california, texas, live, colder, rainy, humid, area, survive, outside, extended, period, time, could, buy, extra, coating, thousand, buck, make, corrosion, resistant, heck, normal, people, dont, care, fast, acceleration, dangerous, real, world, road, situation, make, people, behave, like, douchebags, brings, conclusion, bad, car, good, status, symbol, need, ego, suck, everyone, else, road, want, car, thats, good, stuff, truck, initially, intended, accomplish, fit, actual, real, use, case, get, mitsubishi, fuso, canter",Negative

"So, It is neither a truck or cyber.....what it really is a metal coffin. If you get in a serious accident in this metal box, the chances of you surviving is virtually Zero. There is a reason why we don't build cars out of stainless steel. Since the 1950s at least, automakers have understood that stiffer cars are more dangerous to people inside and outside the car because in a crash they deliver energy to other parties rather than absorbing it. In an early crash test experiments with more heavily built cars, collisions often did only minor damage to the car but turned the test dummies into paste. Since then, cars have been designed with progressively more sophisticated crumple zones to absorb impact forces. Musk‚Äôs boasts of a Cybertruck ‚Äúexoskeleton,‚Äù if true, are a recipe for gruesome carnage. It is hard to make curved shapes with stainless steel, so the truck both looks like a low-polygon video game asset from the PlayStation 1 and also has terrible aerodynamics.
