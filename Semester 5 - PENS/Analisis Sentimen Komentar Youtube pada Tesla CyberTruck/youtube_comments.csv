Lmao you can do the same with pretty much just about any piece of advanced technology like a moth to a flame
It looks like a car homer simpson would make....you know that one episode where they pushed a whole load of cash into designing his own car and when it was complete it looked like a garbage can on wheels? üòÇüòÇ

This review is so obviously paid by Tesla that's not even funny
its not iconic. all it does is let you know the person driving its is a tool

i live in fuckass nowhere texas and there is one (1) single cybertruck that drives around. i'm convinced its the same person because i refuse to accept the idea of multiple people owning a cybertruck in fuckass nowhere texas. it feels like a monster creeping up in me whenever i see it in my rearview

"I don't know why people get the idea that hospital bills in the US are insane here inside this comment section. My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. 

These black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). 

We also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.

Crime rate? 

Luxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.
Latvia has a 4.05%.
Finland has a 1.5%.
Turkey has a 2.46%.
Estonia has a 1.35%.
Lithuania is 2.21%.

What about the US?

Maine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!
New Hampshire is 1.26%
Connecticut is 1.5%
Mississippi is 2.45%
Kentucky is 2.14%

Is the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.

I find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy? If people like the big truck and a place allows it and the voters are fine with it in that country, then let it be."

i absolutely love the look. I would prefer if it was satin stealth matte black. But it is very sci fi futuristic and the aesthetics are super cool. I feel like the online hate is largely due to Elons polarizing personality.

Looks pretty fine tho

Wrong analogy. Same thought but this time imagine a VW beetle. You're too young to remember when they first hit the street. Same reactions as the cybertruck. Millions of them  on the road and that same feeling lingers....Very rare to obtain true icon status. Jury is still out on the Cybertruck.
To some of y‚Äôall here: Stop complaining and move on if you‚Äôre so repelled by a frikin car. Seriously gtfoh and go to a video that bashes the cybertruck. It‚Äôs not a casual daily driver and is meant to be an outlandish ‚Äútruck‚Äù.

"It‚Äôs very weird to me that Marques considers variable ratio steer by wire a good feature.

The tech equivalent would be to use mouse acceleration on a computer. Yuck.

Gordon‚Äôs T50 did it the correct way. Clutched in power steering at low speeds, not variable ratio."
If someone hits you... you will not be fine... your car will... but you won't. There's a big reason why every car is designed to crumble in an accident
This is a good tesla right

"The F150 is a conservative fashion statement.  You know, like ""I have small hands so I buy the biggest truck I can find to make up for my inadequacies, wasting 400 gallons of fuel annually!"
33.5' turning radius is excellent.  Anything less than 35' can generally turn around on any street without backing and filling ...
"They gave you steer by wire and four wheel steering, but you paid for drive automation it doesn‚Äôt have. Perhaps the two are related since a non variable steering column is programmed differently than the one the truck needs. But you paid for it."
The cybertruck is an icon of the dystopian future! A future that doesn‚Äôt work! A warning for anyone who might think of buying a Tesla!
Iconic?  Yes.  Good?  No.
Imagine waiting 2 years for this trash
..... My child is crazy
The Windows Are So Dope!!!
Black man made the design way b4 this truck ever hit the market! We are looking @ a truck that already tried to get created but just now got the technology to bring it to life
Bro‚Ä¶ Maybe I should do my research but how do you get all of this technology‚Ä¶ I gotta get my game up though & for sure will invest soon!
Might take a couple years for people to not behave like that frfr
The winch on the back of the tesla cybertruck being strapped on by PLASTIC is a crime in istelf

"one thing i want to say, the truck has steer by wire meaning if it gets stuck in mud it will be almost impossible to get out without the help of another truck or winch"
I personally think Rich Rebuilds has the best take on this truck
I kept thinking how dangerous those pointy metal corners are for other vehicles/people on the roads‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
"Just keep one thing in mind, the cybertruck and like everything else in the world is not for everyone, I personally like it but wouldn't get one till at a later date when some of the issues do get fixed, looks and appearance do not matter to me just like with people I simply do not care what you look like, if it drives and it is suitable for me then I like it, simple as that. (This comment is aimed towards the viewers)"
People wondering if steer by wire is safe just keep in mind that airplanes are steering by wire üòÖ
Is robocop iconic? Because it looks like something out of robocop
The Volkswagen bug is iconic and heavily mass produced.

I honestly don‚Äôt mind the look I think it‚Äôs kinda cool but I dislike everything else about the truck
Karmann Ghia. mass produced. you'll get more looks with that thing than a Lamborghini any day of the week.

This shit aint a review...
WhistlinDiesel tested it where its rear bumper just shears off from a tow... lmao paper thin bodyframe no one should buy this

"Well my personal truck only gets used for towing a few times a year, but the invaluable part is just having an open ended bed. I use that all the time. Of course there are cheaper options for open ended beds, but an SUV is absolutely not the same use case."
i actually like the design. Very futuristic. And about damn time

I literally expected marques to tear the cybertruck apart for how shitty it is but instead got suprised by the way he was glazing it

It‚Äôs pretty obvious üòÖ"
"Are you... sure the most dangerous thing isn't its lack of crumple zone?
I was really interested in your channel, from the buzz about your ""controversial"" review, but it feels incredibly disengenuous how much you gloss over really important problems with this vehicle.The highlights seem great, and I can agree with a lot of those innovative pieces of tech in the vehicle being useful, but did they need to be in a rigid body steel block, that you cannot see out the back of without taking your eyes completely off the road?"
"I was invited to the second step and gave Tesla  another $1000. There‚Äôs something off though so let me know what you think:
1. I did the original preorder in June 2021. I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!
2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven

Does this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas. Where can I see reliable information on how many cars they made and how many preorders still exist?

Also, was considering renting it on Turo for like $350-400/day. Thoughts on the feasibility?"
Good ‚ù§ Sound Quality on this Video. Great work here man! üëç
"you also forget to mention the BIGGEST thing when towing your range gets at least cut in half or more, as a reviewer thats a critical thing you need to mention tbh"
"honestly tech reviewers reviewing vehicles is just not a good idea tbh!, they don't i think truly understand what customers want especially in trucks, they focus on alot of the tech, that steering wheel thing really isn't special lets be real but he never reviews average joe cars"
"Your 911 Turbo is an iconic design that's evolved over what, 60 years? And how many tens of thousands of them are on the roads?"
Nah in Miami every one has a cyber truck
Can you get it lifted?
JAJAJA look line a aluminum can with wheels..
"""steer by wire"" or electric power steering exists even on Russian Ladas. Tesla are the new king of turning 50 year old technology into an innovative feature."
also like... is it fine? is it fine that you buy a fking massive truck that you can't see like half a metre in front of the dashboard and would literally flatten a cyclist on impact  just cos it looks cool... and not cos you need it to perform literally any of the functions it is SO BIG and dangerous to achieve?
"Very well researched, as usual.   Thx.  I think I will order mine."
The Porche ad is fake
"So, it's basically a futuristic looking El Camino...aight cool"

My decade old Mustang has steer-by-wire...
So one thing the steering mechanisem is soooo overrated because if get dirt over the sensors or the sensor are blocked from anything your gone so i think its pretty overrated
you got the best presentation skill in the world.
He actually thinks that millions of idiots will buy that thing??
It‚Äôs ugly and beautiful at the same time. Brilliant! ‚ú®
MKBHD is kinda biased on Tesla
does Iconic mean ugly?
I look at it because Im still shocked at the lack of creativity that went into the design by the team at the local kindergarten.
...the intro was so cool I got whiplash to the panning of the actual truck because I forgot how stupid it looked.
"I am old enough to remember the PT cruiser and yes- thought the design was super cool. But then I drove it and it was a DOG. Not just bad, terrible. Cyber Truck? I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the design but after driving it?? Sweet! ‚ù§"
"Car accident smh üòÆugly , waste of money ive seen 2 in NC on the road"

Bro used stealth technology
I heard its a üí©.
Jeeze did I like that video. One of the best review ever made by Marquee. So informative while being entertaining.
"being iconic means a historic distance to begin with. further it has to put a mark on an era, to become its symbol. this monstrosity is a testament of times it was created in at best: purposeless, impotent, ugly... fake."
I cant even imagine what it would cost to repair these trucks after a mild accident. I think its safe to say most body shops have no experience fixing stainless steel body panels. You cant just fill with bondo and color match the paint..
"I don't think the wacky design will wear off on people when it's mass produced. I see goofy cars like the Nissan Cube all the time and I still always think ""why would you buy that?"" Dodge Rams are also getting very popular where I live (I see them almost daily now) and I think the same thing. When cars stick out like a sore thumb, I don't think people will be desensitised."
The ugliest car ever made!
"I'm so happy this is a topic for a MBL video because the rubber necking trend around certain vehicles can be extremely dangerous, and its interesting to see it brought to the ultimate level here."
Damn i never thought there would be uglier car coming from the usa.

the VW was also mass produced but still iconic.
"Them : so what topic are you touching on about the cyber truck?

Does the fingerpring door unlock work in wet conditions
They're not laughing with you....
Have you seen how badly this thing has been failing? The amount of times it has had to be towed?
"Maaaan, he's so nervous he's gonna say the wrong thing. If he comes out as an Elon bootlicker, it's over . If he pisses off Elon bootlickers, it's over. I swear he was clenching his asshole so tight the microphone picked up the sound :D"
"You come across as a fan boy ofvthis product and not an unbiased reviewer.  You failed to mention any of the safety issues with this vehicle.  The less than stellar brakes, the aharp edges, the failure to consider the damage to other people if this hits them.  Pump the 0 to 60 but whats the 60 to 0.  Fail to mention this vehicle has no independent crash test data.  I could go on.  I have seen you review many other products with a more critical eye."
It's not very fun it's very dangerous and YouTubers like yourself are playing into that with people who are unqualified to drive vehicles of this size at that speed you're pedestrians in these locations there are other cars
Just fyi you can modify diesels to run through deep water.

The steering you completely ignore the fact that there's almost a full second delay at high speed and because you don't have any road feel feeding back into that steering wheel it's going to lead people to oversteer and overcompensate.  Other reviews have shown suburbans having as good or better turn radius.
Iconic failure.
Ugliest thing on the road and I'll die on this hill
"The most dangerous thing is the hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children in the Congo crammed into industrial cobalt mines to get the resources for vain luxuries such as this that we seem to take such pleasure in flaunting."
Totally not biased
So you are here to just endorse the cybertruck üí∞? This is not a review !
"Looks like a stealth lunar rover.  When they reach end of life, we can load them all onto Elon's SpaceX rockets and decorate the moon with them.  All those stainless steel mirrors will reflect a lot more moonlight onto the earth at night, so we'll be able to save some electricity at night."
no!
"I suppose the Elephant Man got alot of stares as well, is his look iconic?"
The shilling is wild here
"I think one of the most impressive aspects of the truck is how they've managed to remove the risk of anybody keying your car. Now all you need to do is run your finger across the body, and you've fcked it up well enough."
AFter All Of That @ 1:10
4 recalls
Looks like a mac on wheels. Im surprised thats not apple that owns it.
So when a steering sensor fails then what? Is there some other way to control the vehicle?
It‚Äôs hardly iconic. It‚Äôs already been proven to be an unreliable POS disaster. Tesla should be utterly embarrassed by their lack of quality control and care in craftsmanship. In a few years independent used car lots will be selling these for $15K.
pretty sure the biker gave you the thumbs down because he understands that if he gets in an accident with a cyber truck he's dead
Ohhhh its iconic already. Probably not for the reason youd like. A cool vehicle does not illict the urge to point and laugh at it when it passes.
Truck looks like it came out of mine craft
I littelry drove this car in roblox before i knew of it existence
What happens when you get into a accident are there crumple zone to protect your body from the effects of the impact?  The skin does not seem to allow that if it‚Äôs ‚Äú indestructible‚Äù
Bullet proof stainless steel overrated ü§ì real MF‚Äôs realizing that tupac would still be alive rn if he was in the ‚Äúoverrated stainless steel cybertruck

"You could've killed Tesla but you chose honesty, disappointed"
"Bunch of Tanks rolling around the streets , will look like foreigner country where everyone is forced to look and drive the same thing. Hilarious and when the government decides to shut you down you wont be able to drive your car or worst there is an issue with Electricity and your dead in the water because you cant charge"
I never knew so many people cared about the safety of others until I read the comments in this video.
√≠conic@
Far as safety. It's bulletproof. Impact is more dangerous if it hits you vs. you driving.
The straight line speed has always been a bit ridiculous considering you'd bin the car into the ditch at the slightest curve in the road...
The cybertruck isn't the first car with ss body panels.  The delorean was SS as well.
This gotta be the most iconic intro ever !
Oneday when i get rich I'll buy one and drive it here in Ghana üòä
I'm just glad that this thing is not legal in the civilized world.
"Dude, once the price drops at the end of the year, nobody is going to be looking anymore. Stick to the actual features"
"I think it looks decently cool. For a pickup truck, it's good. The issue is that Tesla's testing and QC is garbage. They're basically killing people"

It‚Äôs ugly and stupid. End of review.
This dood is the real life Tolken üòÇ
He's somewhat jealous.  He has all gass  cars .difficulty transitioning. Humm !
This video is a perfect summation of why I don't like this guy's content.  It's a review of hype that's both too vague and far too narrow.
"‚úãunbelievable , company like tesla is making such worst design, as it looks like just thy have to launch the vehicle they have launched, secondly it's reflection during day will hamper the other car driver."
"So, I get an ugly truck AND strangers keep coming up to me and bothering me?"
Probably firt ever concept car to reach production
"An entire 30 minute ""review"" and not a single negative thing mentioned. I never lost so much respect for Marques as I did watching this."
Have you had the opportunity to review the collaboration between Sony and Honda resulting in the EV Afeela?
The design looks like it was inspired by a razor blade and sharks and I'm here for it. Coolest thing on the road!
"I remember someone has a video where they mentioned that the Cybertruck is basically Musk's brain child and it basically encompasses what's wrong with his mindset
The truck is fast and cool looking sure, but also hugely impractical and is basically an engineer's nightmare. 

The product wouldn't have been mass produced had it not been for Musk throwing money at it."
Isuzu Dmax >
Looks like something from Total Recall‚Ä¶ the original movie with Arnold.. not that crapstain remake
"Piece of unprotected steel, hence the ""truck"" with the smallest trunk. Idk what's iconic about this car, besides the looks."
G wagon is iconic and it is mass produse
"if you do trafic to trafic light full power , battery down in less then 1 hour , and change tires in a few months "
Its ugly.
"Was this just a product placement video?  No mention of the rapid rusting?  Or the user manual that states you shouldn't wash it in sunlight, or leave it out in the rain? No mention of the reliability issues and the panels falling off?
ü§î"
"Yeah Marques I'm gonna be honest I've been kinda falling out of love with your reviews the last few years and I think this was the final nail in the coffin. Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn't take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the ""most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck"" while speeding past it's more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. Hell, if anything the more real ""danger"" is that I'd be willing to bet a significant amount of drivers will be nastier to and more inclined to drive aggressively around a Cybertruck than other vehicles. 

I just kinda feel like if you're not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?

Haven't seen the video you did about it for your car review channel, hoping that one is better but I'm not holding my breath. Tbh I might just skip it."
It puts Lamborghini to shame
It‚Äôs ugly and pointless
Marques definitely owns Tesla stock.
"Marques, this video throws your credibility out the fken window. If this is how you gloss over all the problems and ignore most of the complaints, then I imagine a lot of your videos are just as bad, but hard to notice unless your very well versed in the tech..."
"As for guessing the price, I think it's not surprising people guess way over, it's kinda like guessing a woman's age, you want to go safely complementary if you have any social awareness about you."
Who did the intro? It's fantastic.
UGLIEST CAR EVER
woww
"I mean, I get what he's saying regarding the towing issue, but...what about the other 37% of people who DO want towing? That's still, like, millions of people, right?

I think he also missed another aspect that people use trucks for and that is a large bed to transport large things. Plywood, gravel, tools, furniture... I think the average truck owner probably *does* use this feature at least somewhat regularly. And the cybertruck's bed just isn't all that large.

If you actually needed that functionality and wanted an ev, the cybertruck is just nowhere near a viable option..."
"I think it won't be the same fate as the PT cruiser, because while one is typecast as being the one bought used by normal people with not a lot of money, this will always be the marker of a tool with more money than sense."
I feel like the Cybertruck is only iconic because of how ugly it is. It catches your eye because it stands out like a sore thumb.
Why not talk about the safety concerns regarding driving around in a bullet proof tin can. No such thing as a bullet proof crumple zone
"Didn't learn anything new about the ugly tuck, but certainly learned not to listen to this fanboy"
Honestly saw In real and it looks amazing so unique.. I love it personally
"If the top speed wasn‚Äôt electronically limited and reached before the end of the 1/4 mile, would it have won the drag race?"
"C'mon... really???
It's an updated Delorean!"
"I didn't know about cybertruck before the reviews started coming.
And I'm very online though not on social media like facebook or reddit and I'm not into cars at all."
"Its ugly, over priced and we already know that Tesla Employees have abused the Camera System on Teslas to Spy on people in their own homes (garage) in the past. There is Also the MAJOR ISSUE OF BATTERY RECYCLING THAT EVERYONE IGNORES (LACK OF).

So the only staring that you'd get from me is the in disbelief someone wasted their money yet again.

Anyone remember how many miles the Tesla Semi is supposed to go before it breaks down (Garaunteed by Elon)? Wasn't it a million miles?  Hahaha snake oil salesman.

Guess GM is just as bad, selling your info to insurance companies and data brokers etc...

Ever thought of covering those real world issues? Or NO, might hurt the wallet too much?"
"""dump truck vibes"" LMFAOOOOO hes so serious and unserious at the same time"
I have feeling like Porsche started little delayed on this first drag shown in the video
Does anyone know what kind of hoodie Marques is wearing?
Its iconically shitty that's for sure.
I love  it box on wheels  üõû üòç üòã üòä my tank
Iconic + mass production = revolution
beautiful!!!! want one!
Black wrap makes this cybertruck look even better
imagine getting one of these rolling fridges and not being allowed by Tesla to sell it.
"Steer by wire is overrated. Prove is that you hadn't yet realized that most cars you were driving for the past ten years have steer by wire.
Judging by how you rate it I assume the steering calibration and drive train od the cybertruck is underrated."
People stop making EM filthy rich.  He is smart at fooling people to buy his crap.  He is another Enron in the making.  Burn your $$ instead of giving to him.
üòÇ people watching you - a good reason to choose your car :) ‚Ä¶ imbecility
"was in santa barbara last week for vacation and saw a surprising number of them, or the same one over and over, cant tell coz they are all the same 'colour'!"
"""They had to get creative"" that's a funny way to describe misleading advertisements."
Paid advertisement rather than a review
He completely brushes off pedestrian safety. This is almost like a paid for endorsement.
"I'm unhappy that this vehicle was released to the public with the frunk's original issue of potentially breaking off a finger if caught in the side while closing (yes, Tesla has since fixed this) or the other issue of potentially lacerating your face or losing an eye while the frunk lid is open (or the back corner of the bed). I see this as extremely dangerous and yet the governing bodies decided this was not enough of a public safety issue to care. What's the point of safety regulations if they're ignored? I guess now we wait for the potential lawsuits from injuries due to the Cybertruck being designed the way it was."
"they are not pointing becuase they think its a cool car bro, hate to break it to you but they are making fun of you, the only reason its ""iconic"" is becuase there is finally a car worse than the ford pinto"
"26:30 NOOOO!!!!!!  The prowler is what's your name...

note... Where are those PT cruisers at now?
 They were pieces of junk!"
Looks like Delorean made an electric truck
"I didn't want to buy this truck until watching this video.
 yep I don't want to buy this truck.
 give me a mega cab dully Cummins"
"Bit of a Tesla fanboy, so far your only flaw. Not this video. But in general."
"as time goes on, video games look better. from polygon ps2 games to hyper realistic ps5 games
as time goes on, cars does the oposit. from stylish normal cars, to ps2 polygon unrendered cars"
Do you not know how to drag race do don't start from idle when the light drops the car should already be up in the rpm especially for a turbo
"There are a lot of things that have been said about the review and such, but one thing is the comparison to the size of an F-150;  It's shorter, but it's about the length of a mid-sized F-150 model and is considerably wider.  What gives?"
one of the ugliest vehicles ever. looks like a lazy design
üòÇit looks like a refrigerator on wheels
"I think it's time to talk about of CEO of the Company your channel covers.  I strongly feel that he's undermining the institutions of our country pushing false conspiracy theories.  He is on the phone reportedly with the former President several times a month now and this person was recently convicted of 34 felonies by a jury of his peers, and his corporation was recently convicted of 17 felonies as well.  Elon is claiming without evidence that the trial was politically motivated and not fair.  Not only that, but Elon is selling cars allegedly to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but has joined forces with a political party that has worked to prevent any Climate legislation for 40 years.  I've been following the Tesla development and brand for many years, but I feel the time has come now that we can't separate this CEO and this company from what it's CEO is working to do, which I feel is trying to destroy this great nation we live in.   Please consider this.  Thank you."
"Side is like Lamborghini, just sharper."
I heard there are bad blind spots.  True or false?
You are brilliant.  You were enjoyable to watch.  :)
"Damn, this vehicle is so cool, weird and nerdy. I am gonna wait until it is improved, safe and until I get rich to buy it :D"
"And why does nobody talk about the visibility... with the A-pillar where it is, and literally zero visibility out the back and in blind spots. Super unsafe and frustrating driving experience compared to a traditional truck design, which has existed for something like a century for a reason. If it ain't broke, it don't need fixin!"
"Cybertruck is like that episode of Seinfeld where the girl looked great in one kind of light, and like a ghoul in another type of light. It can look good from certain angles... but I watched one drive past today and, I mean, really.... it looks terrible"
"C‚Äômon man! This thing is iconically terrible. No need for a 9mm round, just take an ice pick to the side panel."
Kudos to EU for not allowing this garbade to be allowed to drive on their roads due to its hazardous design.
"This BS is peak late stage capitalism. There is no actual valid reason for this 'truck' to exist. Why does it exist? Because there are tons of people with lots of money who don't an ounce of common sense and Elon decided he can make a quick buck from them. But is it necessary, no. As resources dwindle, commiting vast resources into useless impractical stuff like this vehicle should be discouraged or even regulated."
It is a very impractical vehicle. It is not a practical truck and the only reason to buy this monstrosity is as a gaudy attention grabber vehicle like Hummer H2/ H3. The only advantage it has is it being an EV but Rivian and Ford have much better EV trucks.
"cybertruck review: ""ignore all the problems guys they'll fix it in future""

humane pin and fisker review: ""never trust companies on what they promise for the future, judge the the product at hand not what they say they will do in future""

i see what's happening here"
How much did Elon pay for this???
So when you're using the truck on set do you park it out of the sun and clean it with the special products to prevent it instantly rusting or ... ?
If Kanye can have the ppl wear expensive homeless clothes surely musk can have ppl drive an experience refrigerator around to look coolüòÇü§£

"Teste is subjective. 
To me the thing is  Iconically UGLY looking Car"
Idk man the glare light reflection might partially influenced a response üòÖ
Aren't cars supposed to absorb the impact when in an accident to keep the people inside safe? And not just be a huge block of metal that could  potentially crush other normal cars??? Am I missing something here?
"Cybertruck buyers, I got just one question:
How stupid do you feel? Now that you know what you gotten into.

Also, black and stainless are for appliances. Be real."
Sell in
i want this to be in transformers form
"i love your review, quite insightful, good Job"
Pretty sure Lexus was the first steer by wire car manufacturer
"16:54 :  'physics just takes over' might imply that physics was dormant during the race. Yet, physics was at play right from the onset for both cars, evident as the motor's induction generated instantaneous torque."
Im here because i want to see the inside of it.
"It's iconic, like the Edsel is, or the Microsoft Zune."
"While Marques is one of the most respectable tech youtubers, it's quite painful to watch this."
"Having had the elecronics in a car shut down randomly with the dealer and mechanic having NO IDEA what happened, I'm sorry but I will NEVER trust a computer to proxy my steering no matter how high the benefits. And yes, I know that airplanes use the tech."
"This might turn out to be one of the worst lemons of all time.  I have never heard of a car having this many commonly-experienced issues, from ones that can render the vehicle un-driveable(red screen of death for indeterminate reasons, don't take it through a car wash) to ones that cause damage to it(the windshield wiper can catastrophically fail leading to scratching the windshield, setting suspension height to maximum can cause it to damage itself), to ones that are just unfortunate(rusting?  Tonneau cover seals getting jammed up?  Windshield wiper motors burning out?).  It's hard to keep up with the myriad array of issues that are *common* to this truck, and it's hardly been on the road a few months!  As they get driven more the issues just pile up, with people now reporting on the CT forums that their side mirrors are rattling/shaking, and a couple of people even reporting that their entire drivers-side door is shaking at speed.  It sounds like they're literally falling apart."
Every time i see a cybertruck i wonder which poor smuck got scamed this time around
"PT Cruiser would have been cool if it had been a good car.  Mechanically it really was horrible. The ones I had the misfortune  to drive anyway.

The Cyber Truck sounds like a decent machine but its practicality is questionable. Throwing anything into the bed frkm the side looks impossible.  As does ladder racks and utility beds. You know, work stuff!"
"I finally had a chance to see one of these up close and test drive one. It also had giant panel gaps all over and it‚Äôs build quality was also extremely poor outside AND in. The tires were damaged from the wheel covers, the dash panel was warped for some reason, and the bedcover was crooked. Also, I found out from the owner that this thing is so dangerous it can‚Äôt pass European safety standards. The leeway given in these reviews by Marques, saying future builds will fix all of these issues, is mind blowing to me. Especially, given the inconsistency in his criticism compared to other product reviews‚Ä¶ Tearing other products apart for not launching in the condition for which they were promised by the company before launch, but in this video he just makes excuses again and again for all of the glaring problems and missing features when it comes to this literally poorly made steel death machine. It‚Äôs kind of astounding. Personally, I did find the drive by wire steering to be the best thing about the cybertruck after driving it. But they could have put that technology in anything else that wasn‚Äôt just poorly designed and poorly manufactured in so many other respects. I honestly question Marques‚Äô ethical principles as a reviewer after watching these cybertruck reviews in comparison to his other reviews. Just disappointing."
Stick to phones bruh
I will always come back for more if you keep being as honest a reviewer as you have been thus far. Congrats

Anyone seen the crash test results? That its not published tells you it cant be good.
Going ptetty much like a DeLorean.
"sorry this was a propaganda clip; poor all the bicyclists and pedestrians or small cars which will be harmed by this needless truck (and indeed all SUVs and pickup trucks; the stat noted in this clip speaks for itself: hardly any pickup owner uses it for what it was designed and instead pickup trucks are used to be a bully on the road; pickup trucks have gotten so large that cannot fit into a standard home garage; so much for using an electric vehicle to be environmentally ""friendly"" (which would mean to be more cognizant of others on the road or living) and all that b/s about 0 to 60 or bulletproof windshield or body, gee,  image a braindead w/ AR who just shot-up a school and now wants to get away with a bullet proof Cybertruck; what has our society came down to) (almost everything the host said is wrong now, just about 2 months after the clip was published: Tesla making money on everything it does, I do not think so; keeping people employed, I do not think so; Tesla being innovative, I do not think so; Cybertruck be mass produced, I do not think so) (when do you suppose Cybertruck be sold in Europe: hum, not in my life time, because it does not meet pedestrian safety, to say the least)"

"This vehicle breaks more often than a 7th grade relationship. Not to mention, the people who buy these are lame as hell. Tesla is a terrible company run by a terrible person."

"sweet, a truck that'll match the graphics on my N64. :P"
"This review is so nauseating. You can't just say that the thing sucks at towing and offroading, you also have to defend it with ""oh you shouldn't be taking this thing off road anyway"", even though it's literally been advertised or at least heavily implied in advertisements that it's an off road vehicle and has an off road mode. Defending the build quality when it shows atrocious QC, and believing Musk when he says that only 15 vehicles have been found with this fault, and somehow 2 out of those 15 made it to high profile reviewers? Yeah right. It's actually gross, can you kiss Elon's ass crack any harder?"
Ahhh rich people problems.
I actually don't think it's fine that people will use these just because it looks cool. Same with all of the giant SUVs and lifted pickups on the road nowadays. This shit is not safe for my baby corolla to get hit by.
Lol if the only positive thing you can think of is ‚Äòpeople talk about it‚Äô you‚Äôre not being real
"Nice AD and sellout.

I can get the same looks and interactions in my car from the 50‚Äôs. And an added bonus of old people sharing stories from back when they were my age and riding around in one. Sweet old people are the best.
I don't know why they didn't build the doors to open like a Delorean.
"I think it's funny that the worst things about the cyber truck are elon related. The insistence on the design. The cutting corners and quality control. Even people assuming you're an asshole if you drive one is almost entirely down to musk

the engineering stuff underneath actually seem pretty cool. Wish they'd take the guts to make a more conventional truck that uses more competent design"
I always thought they looked dumb until I saw one in person and it made me smile. They are growing on me for sure.
Your entros are just INSANE!!!!!!!!!
"Overrated, overpriced, ugly"

"The Hummer EV is so heavy that when they ship it, they have to leave parts off of it to qualify it as light duty for shipping purposes."

I mean you could argue it's not exactly fine since SUVs and other big vehicles are more dangerous to pedestrians so people buying them purely for cool factor actually endangers others."
It's a silly toy truck for rich people...

"tesla was like: ""f*ck aerodynamics, and weight savings ."""
Not one review discusses if the seats are comfortable for long distance. I have owned 2 teslas (X & S) and don‚Äôt find the seats comfortable for long distance driving.
"It is a useless bulletproof truck, which nobody will use as a truck nor will anyone drive it into a warzone. Nothing can be iconic when it doesn‚Äôt do perfect what it is perfectly designed for. The VW Bus and Beetle, the Mustang, the Citroen Deux Chevaux, the Rolls Royces, the Audi TT were all brilliant in what they were designed for. This truck will become a icon of our decadent times, but can by lack of functional perfection, never become an iconic cardesign."
INSTEAD OF LYING COULDN'T THEY HAVE JUST SAID IT BEATS THE PORSCHE OFF THE LINE WHILE TOWING ONE! THAT TO ME IS IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.. THE FACT THEY LIED JUST KILLS IT..... YOU GUYS LIED. AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO üòÇüòÇüòÇ

All you fenomems doing reviews-why don't you put 3 children from age 3-9 in front of this cyber bumpster and explain what would happen if it hit one of them-Do you know they cannot be sold in all of Europe because of the pedestrian law? Do you know the US does not have this law? Do you know this is not tecnically a TRUCK? Do you know this is the biggest industrial scam of them all and in 2 years time Tesla will be Chinese owned and Electric  X Jesus will be broke...Yoy might as well review hair growing oil and grass that instantly grows in the desert-They are far more likely to succeed.

not as nice as truckla
Its ugly tho!
"Im not sure if you would be safe if you get into a car crash tbh..
I could be wrong, but I think this car is not safe, it doesn't absorb the force at all, the more a car crumples, the safer it gets, but I don't think its the case for this car..."
do all the straight lines make it cheaper to produce? i hope so
This could be a cool time machine
"People hating hard on this are just those who hate Tesla for existing. It is a cool design which is turning heads and getting reactions out of people whether positive or negative. I'd get one if I had the money but then again, if it's true this can get stuck in snow, that's not good....That's really REALLY BAD."
Why don‚Äôt you make a video about how all ev‚Äôs prices are dropping specially in the used market ?
"This is a car for sociopaths. It will NEVER be for sale in Europe for the simple fact that it is a fatal menace to others on the road. Build quality is shit.  Design is shit. Tesla launched it in a shroud of lies and deceptions. Marques, you're a preternaturally talented product reviewer, but before you make the transition from  electronic gear to cars, please do your homework."
"Some basic information missing from this review: 1) Keeping the vehicle clean is a major issue, and putting it through a regular car wash is definitely not recommended. 2) There are issues with the vehicle rusting. 3) The panel edges are dangerously put together, such that people risk losing their fingers when closing the doors and trunk."

Also, you can tell from the design that they really wanted it to look like a cross between the DeLorean and the armored vehicle from Aliens."
"People are already selling these for $150,000, used. lol. That's the price of a house."
"The thing about this review is I feel that you are mainly reviewing modern American culture rather than the truck. You start to talk about towing -but shift to talk about how most people don't tow. You start to talk about off-road performance, but shift to talk about most people not going off-road. What is the actual towing or off-road capability of the Cybertruck? You didn't say, but instead essentially invalidated the question, telling us we don't care. You say it steers well, which is an actual car review thing, but never talk about the size of the bed of the truck, or the comfort of the backseats. As has been mentioned the most iconic car design has always been the Volkswagen Beetle - affordable and everywhere for decades.  The Cybertruck may be iconic in the way the PT Cruiser is iconic - a full-sized toy of limited use for people desperate to impress people they pass on the street but don't know."
I'm only angry that I have seen absolutely nothing on that cool ATV Elon had in the back of the cyber truck for the unveiling. I thought every truck came with a matching ATV I was so excited! Lol
I feel I‚Äôm watching Batman or Superman movie if I saw this car on street
RIP pedestrians.
I remember seeing Tesla Infront of my school which is in Greece
"The trouble with iconic is that it doesn't age well. When VW bought back the New Beetle it did very well, but very briefly, and soon it becomes just last years shtick. So you really will have to live with the car after the styling has ceased to be a part of the equation."
Hey Marques. I watched this video and it's awesome ! My question is can you do one on Honda Prologue?
the way you can tell the Cybertruk is an absolute joke of a vehicle is that it literally cannot be sold in Europe because it's completely unsafe.

"I'm from Malawi üá≤üáº, Africa. I love the cybertruck n EVs. I hope one day I'm gonna afford one.‚ù§"
"Really nice to watch and very informative video , thank you very much !"
Cybertruck is the love child of the Pontiac Aztek and a Delorean.
"Different times and different vehicles but reminds me of the Hummer H2 craze back in the day,  that it would turn head everywhere you would drive it."
The cybertruck copied the original hummer in some ways. its a ridiculous vehicle and represents excess. it will end up the same way. a symbol of excess.
this reminds me to the Lancia Stratos Zero with that weird simple blocky looking
Ignoramuses never understood Van Gogh's art when they first came out! Now some of them are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and only well established museums could afford to own them!
Tf is that pile of metal?!üòÖ
"Tesla will no doubt get credit for ""inventing"" steer by wire, while Lexus introduced it in 2022, likewise the four wheel steering is already available for years with Cadillac, GMC, Lamborghini, Mercedes-Benz, Acura, BMW, Rolls-Royce and Porsche."
Cool graphics in this review :)
"After this genuine review, I‚Äôm a little disappointed because, I WANT ONE!!"
"Looks like old tomb raider graphics. If you know, you know."
I‚Äôve never seen more people triggered by a car‚Äôs existence üòÇ

Not the other guy tho. There is a reason why cars are designed to be turned into pieces that only a petty narcissist billionare will ever ignore"
"The man on the bike that gave you the thumb down, most likely replies that way to every single tesla or Electric car. I can imagine biking must be better for the environment than the manufacturing of tesla's or any other electric vehicle (in the eyes of those who strive to be such).  Anyone who can appreciate cars, or are enthusiast for the combination of both tech and cars, would react, much like the happy faces that rolled down the windows."
Are they adding DLC's?
This may be a silly question to ask but is it actually any good to wear a helmet when both of those cars have airbags already?
I would like to drive the cyber truck and see if I like or not

"Marq  I'm sorry. But I think if the people got a WONDERFUL LIFE, they would be complacent enough for U.S. to not prosper, but be proud and happy to produce for us gods. (Being cheeky sir)"
"Idk. 47yrs old. I remember steel cars with WAY more delicate design. Elon needed new tech to create the bare minimum, MARQUES/ELON ""the people is not slow.""üòä"
That video didn't aged well... üòÆ So many problems at Tesla and now the recall. Elon doing begging videos to shareholders for his 55 billion bonus. Super charger employees layed off. MKHD seams to have received an optimal special crafted Cybertruck for the reviewers cuz most Cyber Truck users have received lemons.
You really skipped the truck stuff. So its not a truck for working. Just a truckie shape. Hard pass. Can you even put stuff in the back? At least you showed it towing something. You coulda sell the bullet proof shell better cause trucks get beat up all the time and that would be great. Like to see how much stuff you can carry in the back.      Would wait for future model. Keep the bulletproof shell. Underrated.
"To think that there's a ton of science people that deal with automobile shapes in order to actively reduce the damage a car would do to a human in case of an accident.... 

Tesla: ""Yeah... We're not doing that""

Tesla fan-boys: ""Who cares if my car kills people?""

Reviewers: ""Yeah, no idea what you're talking about""."

Next video: Is the cyber truck more durable than the 1990 Toyota Hilux?
Infamous not iconic
all of tesla means willing beta tester btw not just foundation
First generation in cars in general Gas or electric are beta testers
the truck is smaller than the advertisemnet :) maybe because of you
I want one
Great futuristic design.  It is about time for Trucks to look different.
ƒ∞ really like it it‚Äôs different and looks futuristic but they can improve on this idea and make better versions in the future tho
Tank made for urban warfare.
people stare at this and wonder 'why anyone would buy this' not as some status symbol. I wouldn't want this shit box even for free.
This guy is the sole reason for 2000 of the 4000 cyber trucks sold so far.
looks like the T1ts from Lara Croft in Tomb Raider 1

"Don't have an accident....stainless steel panel are do hard to work on.....I worked for dealership that sold DeLoreans, it's a different thing, those ss panels. Also not wishing you to have accident,  be safe‚ù§"
"Repurpose the steel, fix the windscreen and truck bed, opt for better build quality of the body so it doesn‚Äôt fall apart in water, etc."
"Remember, this is the same guy who didn't like the Fisker because the remote didn't work. This is a vehicle that has been universally trashed by anyone who has used it.
And they spew word salads about credibility. Someone wants to keep being invited to Musk's sermons."
"I really hope we don't end up with ""millions"" of these on the road. Sure, they are cool, hilarious, and fun. But they are also a tangible reminder that rich humans will spend money on things they don't need while others that don't have enough grind themselves into oblivion."
Kitchen appliance on wheels. What a flop.
"Wait a minute. You did a review of it before and it wasn't the best. According to you! Now, you're saying positive things about this truck. You've been MUSKED!! How much did he pay you? ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°"
As time goes on I just keep getting more disappointed in you. Making excuses for Elon still is depressing.
"I wonder, why did you (appropriately) buried Fisks's Ocean but are being so easy on a vehicle ridden with problems, like the CT?"
not true I live in LA seen 100000 of these already no one gives a crap or is impressed with cars over here. This is coming from a car guy too lol
"Already iconic?

Already recalled you mean üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
It's as iconic as a Fiat Multipla.
"If anyone wondering the music in the drag racing section is called ""Hypercrypto - Oomie"""
"I've seen a ton of drag races all over youtube with this thing... but what about the agility course, or at least race track with some tight turns? off-the-line performance is clearly it's strong suit, not speed; there's nothing else really to learn from drag races. What I want to know is, can that 4 corner steer-by-wire system actually make up for the extra weight when it *really* counts, or does the Porche win on a winding road, too?"
i dont even buy this truck for free due to it's ugly design
How do you steer it if its steering by wire and you let the battery die cause the range sucks?
"Elon Musk is trying to tell us something. This car is suppose to be a fortress on wheels. It is not quite there yet, but it will be‚Ä¶ perhaps just in time."

"PT Cruisers were popular, Cher bought a PT cruiser for her kid. Everyone thought it was so cool. Now I think of it as a questionable car bought by questionable owners that typically drive them in a questionable manner."
The truck is not attractive at all and it seems like this truck is designed for some sort of preparation for what‚Äôs to come in the near future or even a social experiment.
"It's hideous. I saw one speeding towards me on the freeway, and my reaction was WTF does one want one of those abomination?"
"Bulletproof skin was a side effect of the chosen material, not a feature that was planned for and added. They didn't sit in a room together and decide if making it bullet proof was worth the time to make it from that steel..... Why pretend like it was a feature to be over or under rated?"
It‚Äôs $100 million
I think I‚Äôm the only one that thinks that‚Äôs a beautiful truck for the 21st-century
"once you park it next to a dumpster, you see the similarities and you can't unsee it. I thought they would try to give truck drivers truck features, but other than it has a bed, it really has a lot of limitations. most truck people want to power their power tools, not really charge another ev (that is a good feature, but it's not great for a truck driver). not confident in the drive by wire feature, why? fsd and how it behaves."
Gaff tape is underated
i want to live in it
"It's funny how you say at 7:30 that people inside of the truck will be fine in an accident, when it's now known that the lack of crumple zones actually puts passengers in more danger."
Personally I'd prefer an army surplus Abrams.
Did you get door fixed
"I don't comment very often, but man, that's a stupid ""truck""."
"What a complete waste of materials? The vehicle should be built out of recycled sham. At 3 tonnes, it is a complete road menace to other road users. The 'A' pillar goes even further into dynamic blind spot creation, and its true utility is questionable, to the point of being inutile."
Pt cruiser and Chevy ssr

Marques you're iconic.... the one in billions who has such a great approach on products! You never disappoint!
Already trash ?
It‚Äôs ugly looks like a ufo
FWIW: my 2008 Toyota Prius was steer by wire
"I‚Äôm subscribed but don‚Äôt watch regularly- man, GREAT VIDEO"
everybody looks at it and they say damn that thing is super ugly
Yes...
I think it looks amazing
My child üòÇ
"Wow, a truck that has less storage than most modern truck, any older truck, most suvs vans or even sedans, hell even a cargo bike is comparbale. A truck that is more dangerous to everyone around it AND the people inside it compared top most vehicles on the road, that has horrific quality control issues, rusts if you look at it funny, AND it blinds people nearby thanks to it being a glare magnet.

I mean it is iconic, for being an absloute disaster.

Also its not surprising that a tech channel didnt even touch on how dangerous sharp angles are to pedestrians, but it is dissapointing. Cars are a massive killer and making one of the deadliest types of car (pickup trucks) even deadlier for looks especially when most pickup truck owners dont need to own one. Most of the need is better served by vans and for the bit where a pickup truck is needed, the bedspace of modern (especially teslas) pickup trucks is bs. 

Oh also bulletproof steel? its bullet resistence is far overstated. 

Personal vehicles dont exist in a vacuum and glossing over its myriad of flaws is promoting a vehicle that is unnecessarily dangerous just because, and it is not fine because it looks good, it makes streets mroe dangeorus, it makes congestion worse, it does mroe damage to roads, and for what, it looking cooler?"
"I swear you can't see any of the indicators from the outside, theyre all tiny bars that sunlight wil easily obscure"
One of the best made videos on youtube i have ever watched
how do you miss your door latch falling off and think its panel gap? You probably pay to have your windshield wipers installed
I think you mean ironic.
The only thing that is missing here is some awesome japanese cyberpunk Itasha on that car!
"Other than its unique appearance, why would you ever want all those large flat reflective surfaces? Why not a flat finish? Will Tesla be willing to evolve the body in future or is this the ""iconic generator"" of its current appearance?"
Horrible
"There are two safety things that really concern me, the bullet proof steel may protect the people inside, but make everything far more dangerous for everyone else on the road, particularly if the protection makes the driver feel more comfortable with speeding or too quickly accelerating. 

Another issue I have is the lack of physical buttons. Touch screens are hard and distracting to navigate, we all know that, it's why we are not supposed to be using our phones while driving. I am well aware that these problems are in know way unique to tesla or the cyber truck, but they are things I worry about."
"I do not feel like this review is as honest as it should be. With a lot of your other reviews, it appears way more honest, but there are MAJOR glaring issues that aren't discussed in this video. Major safety issues. Grossly negligent safety issues. I get it, you're a tech guy, and just saying that comes with a HUGE disconnect for what a car guy review would be."
"it's not just a cybertruck thing, but I can't get over the lack of physical controls... like, wtf do I have to go through a settings menu to do EVERYTHING!? Much like the wire-steering, it feels disingenuous to tout the software being in control as strictly beneficial, when in a lot of cases it's just to make production cheaper."
It's a cool looking truck
iconic in it being the worst possible car
"The only features it is missing to make this truck perfect for me are Heads up display, a dong for towing and has the ability to consume gas or charge ""just in case"""

Consumers are so thirsty for attention
"I like your work, but I find your review of the cybertruck uncharacteristically uncritical. Glossing over all the well--publicized fallings of the cybertruck with ""what do you expect in beta testing"" and ""trucks have been known to get stuck in snow"", and calling the plainly misleading advertising by Tesla ""getting clever"" is disappointing. Also, ""iconic cars"" don't rust after two weeks."
Hey that's island drag way
I'm afraid the goofy design is going to set the precedence. Vehicle designs have been slowly going downhill since the 80s
Aw nah they got Marques in the idiotmobile
"If I'd bother giving a thumbs down, the main reason wouldn't be because it's a Cybertruck, but the evolution of cars getting bigger and bigger and less safe for everyone besides the people inside of them."
that intro was perfect
"MB look like a huge tesla fanboy. There is nothing ""safe"" about that steering wheel, there is no ""override"" or mechanical control. My old car, had a stupid hydrolic issues, and it was hard to steer. Now immagine that your car decide to randomly steer when it feel. Then, you have a tesla. You are alive by chance. 

""The pivot wheel"" is another weakness the thing have. Then I close to video."
"I'll be honest, if I saw a perfectly clean woody PT Cruiser today I'd probably have some internal conflict."
"Just gotta say, that top-down drone shot of the dragstrip is amazing. I can't believe this is the first time I'm seeing the perfect angle to view a drag race."
i love the way it looks
why is mkbhd wearing a shirt of something german frisbee related? i under the frisbee part but why the german flag?
It's ugly. Overpriced. Impractical. Pointless.
I'm surprised nothing was mentioned about safety.  Cybertruck has not been approved for traffic in the European Union
It seems as if the cheapest Chinese manufacturer made a mix of glass and fake metal sandwich.
"This might as well have been paid by Tesla lol every negative thing is like ""but it's tesla guys they're just not done they're watching out for us don't worry"""
"I love your honesty in your reviews, but you also leave a lot of stuff out like what other people go through."
"3:05 I am one those online people yet I only found out about this like last week
(Granted I do really give a shit about tesla or cars in general so it's probably just my lack of interest)"
"The thing i would worry about is mfs coming up when drunk or sum while ur at dinner or some shit and spending 30 minutes trying to dent it cuz they saw online its dent proof. Odds are they couldn't, until u get a big boy with a hammer."
People already bored of them lol
THAT WAS A FIRE ASS CYBERTRUCK EDIT!!
how tf is this a review lmfao
Really interested in the potential for these to turn into like budget/entry ameteur storm chaser setups. Not that I think it's a good idea.
These things are everywhere these days and I just ignore them! Make it safer for them.
How can you review a vehicle and not mention safety like... *at all*? You reviewed it like it's a cool new phone or gaming gadget. It's a 3 ton movable object that's gonna encounter kids on their way to school and bikers commuting in the city (like the one that gave you the thumbs down)
"When it comes to producing Tesla content, you should have your staff take the lead.  Your takes will not age well."

i saw some bozo saying this truck was dangerous because the door could break carrots lol
Damn I work at the studio they shot this at
tell me you got this car for free in exchange for a biased  review without telling me you got this truck for free in exchange for a biased review .
EVs are a scam
I love how everyone says this guy is a good reviewer until it‚Äôs the cyber truck lol
6:45 Was that a tesla Hammer?
"No, it‚Äôs not fine that people are driving this on city streets just because it looks cool."
"‚ÄúIs it ugly?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes‚Äù"
"Disappointed that the truck having the worst internal and external safety design and extreme environmental and infrastructural impact is barely mentioned. 

The safety aspects have already been mentioned in other comments (to add to that though: I don‚Äôt think this will ever be approved for EU sale with anything resembling the current design). 

The impact on environment and infrastructure is arguably even worse though. The sheer mass of this thing makes it so insanely bad. 

This thing is basically two Teslas stuffed into a one to achieve pretty much nothing except literally exponentially more impact on the tires and asphalt. 

This not only increases maintenance cost of both private and public parties by a very significant factor but also a once again a literal exponential increase in microplastics from the tire wear which is already the literal largest contributor to microplastics in the world."
"Thank you soo much for that top view of the drag race. It was soo satisfying to finally see someone show the race in one shot instead of cutting out the whole time. And from the top, no less. Thank you =)"
Ugly bad engineered car. Fisker is 1000 times better!
I think it‚Äôs really disappointing seeing you have a cybertruck. Elon is a horrible person and you are willing giving him money to do more horrible stuff.
What's the intro music song name?
2:04 gyat
the intro was next level
"I think you are looking for ""moronic"", not iconic. You are welcome. Its a clown mobile"
No. Already ironic.
I thought the most dangerous thing was the accelerator getting stuck down üòÇ
"The cyclist will have given a thumbs down because the cyber truck requires large amounts of energy, aluminum and mined materials to build. And as said in the video, most people simply don't need such a vehicle, or it's simply not good for what trucks were once made for."
Reminds me of that truck from the movie Tango&Cash I‚Äôm sure Telsa got the idea from that movie üòÇ
i think it looks dope but at the same time i think its an abomination
"was expecting a ""the worst car I have ever reviewed, for now"" very suspicious"
"A few things you left out in this video: 
1 The bulletproof exterior isn't just overrated, its dangerous. Cars are made to crumple so that the kinetic energy, the force of the crash goes through the car itself instead of your body. Whiplash at best and seriously injured at worst from a simple crash. 
2 You did not mention the ""Car wash mode"" at all. They did not make the seals to the power points well enough to keep water out so they made that mode to close those parts and protect the car. But if you have adhd like me or just having a stressful/busy day, you will forget and brick your 'truck'. Not to mention I've seen posts about this happening and it will void the warranty so you're screwed. 
3 You did mention that the windows are stronger than normal but, specifically they are meant to be shatterproof. Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can't say ive seen one submerged so i don't know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? 
4 You didn't mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don't know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this 'truck' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in? You can't get out the windows thats for sure, and tow companys are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.
I can understand if maybe you didn't want to include these because they specifically weren't your experience, but they should atleast have a footnote in the video instead of completely ignored. (These issues are just from a couple other videos I've seen and im sure there will be more.)"
SIMP SHILLING EXEMPLIFIED
"There's lot of safety concerns with a car like this. The esign is iconic in the way that no one makes cars like this, but there's a reason for that. If the exterior of the car doesn't budge on impact, all the strength of the hit ill go to launching you forwards, making it way more likely that you'll get hurt or worse. An the same goes for any other car you carsh with, the cyber truck absorbs no force in said impact compared to normal cars. That, and wind resistance is also a factor in efficiency as you said. The point is, no one is making them like that because they're smarter than tat. An being iconic in exchange for being less safe, not worth it. Also, it's iconic, but ugly, that's just that."
Deutscher Frisbeesport-Verband e.V. lol
I saw one yesterday. It looks weird and pitiful. It reminds me of the overated Hummer H2 when it first came out.
only in america
It‚Äôs a urinal
"It would be great if you did a video strictly about the towing capabilities, also the bed storage and how big it is. What kind of strap hooks does it have. Great video!"
I could totally see this truck becoming the new standard police cruiser specifically because of the innate bullet resistance.
"its actually illegal in egrmany, cause its not good enough"
"the reasoning that the cybertruck being bad at truck stuff, is not a problem because most people who buy trucks don't use it for truck stuff, is more an argument against buying a truck, than it is an argument for buying this tesla"
"It being indestructible stainless steel is itself a problem. At 7:30 you say that the driver will be fine but thata not true. In fact thats why modern cars are designed to be 'flimsy'. The crumple reduces the force of a crash by having it absorb the kinetic energy of the crash.  If the truck stays rigid and you get into a high speed collision, the other person is dead and you'll still carry the inertia of the truck at a full stop. You'll be flung into the windshield so hard itd be a miracle if you came out uninjured or alive."
10:30  it sounds quite inside while you are talking to us.
Pontiac Aztec is iconic as well... iconic doesn't always mean good.
7:24 üíÄ
"This is an ugly car. No doubt about that. When you have to convince yourself about the looks, you know it is ugly."
Dude I love all your videos but the top down drone view of the drag race is one of the coolest things I‚Äôve ever seen. Killer production on this video!
wrapp it in any color
All Cybertrucks have been recalled btw
Its horrendous
"From a design standpoint, it will never share the same design language as the PT Cruiser because it embodies a stronger sense of modernity. So, what it will become is a benchmark for future design languages that seek to incorporate the Cybertruck's form into new automotive expressions. Will it ultimately achieve this? Who knows‚Äîbut the design suggests a frontier that could indeed prove successful. Why? Because its design serves as a testament to other carmakers that such innovation is possible, given the positive reception it has received, despite the millions of pre-orders that have yet to be fulfilled."
Man these videos keep getting more beautiful
It‚Äôs not okay when Fisker releases a car missing features on launch but it‚Äôs ICONIC when Tesla does it. Not sure about that one. Cars should all be held at the same standard
"tell me you are an elon fanboy without telling me you are

The list is immense & I'm sure you'll agree, those cars lost none of their allure despite copious production runs. Give the truck a chance."
me  to
"Here‚Äôs some food for thought: if the car gets into an accident, what crumples? Something has to, so if the car isn‚Äôt taking the hit, the only one crumpling will be the occupant inside. Not a pretty image. Also, how have people genuinely cut their fingers trying to open the door? It‚Äôs confusing and sad how many are convinced that this is the future. The future has incredibly low standards."
I didn't think a vehicle would remind me of my kitchen sink..
Maybe people where reacting to you not the truck....
"My very first time watching your channel and can i say , yes imma new fan liker and subscriber, i enjoyed your video, the way you speak, the clearness to really understand all that you say, how informing it was along with the many not expected cool points, the content made me pay my full attention, and just over all straight out liked it, so im here im locked in now and you can say you have a new excited fan here fa more, so thanks , i forgot your name but im sure ill know it in no time...from me thanks ...üòä"

"Go watch Drew Gooden's recent ""Cars are getting dumber"" video. You'll see a deeper look into the baffling cost-cutting decisions Tesla have made, especially like the touch screen controls for adjusting the air vents, which MKBHD only gives 2 seconds at 22:05.
There's a literal 4-step touch screen process to 'shut down' your cybertruck. This is an incredibly soft review, and I think the 'typical tesla' design decisions warrant much more criticism"
"The Volkswagen Beetle is still iconic... cheapest, mass-produced car ever made... 

Being mass-produced doesn't necessarily deminish its status. 

Specially if its intention wasn't to be some posh toy only for the hyper rich to show off like the Veyron."
Why is it a truck? It looks like a big car
"This steering thing sounds incredible, it's a shame I hate everything else about the Cybertruck. Here's hoping we get a practical vehicle that has 4 wheel steering in the future. EDIT: 4 wheel steering existed in 1988. üíÄ"
More Ironic than Iconic.
I thnk it is more unique rather than iconic.
"it reminds me of interstellar.. I love it, but i'm not gonna get one until most/all of the bugs and issues are fixed on it. And obviously when I get the sort of money for it. I think this style would look awesome on a sport/hyper car tbh"
I think Cyber 911 is what happened in Terminator
Be careful when you wash this truck!!!!
"Nine One One = ‚ò∫
Nine Eleven = üíÄ"
And here I thought the most dangerous thing is it‚Äòs rigidity and lack of crumple zone
This thing is a beast... Love it.
"You know who this car is for? Divorced, middle aged men trying to impress their daughters underage best friend. Tbf thats probably the reason the F150 etc. exist as well."
"Now if I ever see a cybertruck, I bet I can't help myself, but laugh at it."
It gives you EYE CANCER! It starts rusting the minute you use it on the road. It may  cut off your fingers if you're not super-careful. It's a disaster on wheels.
Really disappointed and concerned you didn't mention the safety of this thing
I‚Äôd say it accomplishes its desired design very well but I don‚Äôt like the design they picked
"The first two years of owning the reissued VW Beetle in 2000 was annoying. EVERYONE wanted to talk about it. I got so sick of people talking about the car. I remember driving down the strip in Las Vegas and people were taking pictures of my car. Right behind them the Bellagio fountains were going off and they were taking pics of my car... By 2002, it had died down. I would never do that again. It WAS easy to find in a parking lot, though..."
"Watching some of your other videos are the whole pin debacle.

This felt like a paid advert in comparison."
You have a good speech dude! So auditive ü§§
Iconic in being so shitty

"The most iconic part about this car is getting humbled off-road by a little Subaru that costs 1/5 as much. The subaru is safer, too."
"The PT Cruiser also retailed for around 25k brand new, I can't see a whole lot of people getting a Cybertruck being as they start at 60k, just sayin'."
Wasnt there a crash recently where the cybertruck was fine but the occupant was badly injured while the occupant of the other written-off car was fine?
"Well this didn‚Äôt age well, did it?  ü§£"
He‚Äôs drunk on power in this video
I am so glad these aren't in Australia yet
Py cruiser was never cool
I think it looks rad.  Esp with the wraps like the Black Wrap is sweeeet!  Straight up cyberpunk.
"In my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt call it a truck. I‚Äôd call it an over glamorized hatchback, but I do respect Elon for being unique."
"""If someone hits you, you'll be fine."" You are just wrong. The energy will not be absorbed by crumple zones as in a normal safe vehicle, so it has to go elsewhere. Namely, your body. Having a seat belt and air bags will help a little but they don't really absorb energy, they redirect it, into you. You won't fly out the windshield but you will be hit by a giant hammer which will snap bone and crush organs."
"Ahh shit, he brought the 911 out! Lol"
Already a pedestrian slicer.
"Dude never seen you before. 
Very objective, friendly and honest.
Good stuff"
it is really iconic like something humanity should never done again.
A car that can‚Äôt crumple or release energy in a head on collision is more dangerous than anything in the road
"Best looking vegetable peeler out there

Stainless reputation"
iconic for being a strange and nonpractical piece of rust
"every feature listed as a plus for this vehicle ONLY EXIST FOR COST CUTTING PURPOSES
üö´DO NOT BUY THESE DEATHTRAPSüö´

i just watched a breakdown of the steering system and its ""redundancies"" and i am thoroughly unimpressed

this is a reckless endangerment machine, not a car"
you couldn't pay me to drive that thing. so ugly
People that thought that piece of shit was worth 300k are also the same people that think a red Camaro is a Ferrari.
"You spent so much time talking about a truck going faster than a sports car. Why?  Like, i like apples, but i don't need an apple that does my taxes.  A truck has no business going that fast besides nerds durtling in a lab and showing off to their tech bros.   Why do we need a 7,000 lbs steel brick travelling that fast just to go to costco/soccer practice and back?  It's going to kill people with it's no-crumble-zone frame."
What an incredible review. Loved the production. Don‚Äôt care about the car but still stayed until the end.
"How's it iconic?? Just looks like some old 1970s design for the future??
Basically trying too hard"
Infiniti was shipping cars with steer by wire at least a decade ago
Imagine crashing one into a solid object. 100% of the energy will be transferred directly into the occupant and accelerate through the windscreen. Nobody is talking about the obvious safety issues of using steel body panels. It's not just pedestrians who will suffer more if you hit them. Without crumple zones and deliberately designed energy transferring body panels the Cybertruck stands to act as a death trap for the drivers and passengers inside. It's unbelievable that higher safety standards don't already exist in the USA which would have prevented the current Cybertruck design from ever being allowed on a public road.
it's not a cybertruck thing people have been slowing down to gawk at wrecks since cars first existed
So Im the only one seeing a delay in porsche's launch
The real reason most people buy trucks is to boost their fragile egos and bring a false sense of meaning to their lives. I pitty truck owners.
oh god... people really do be living in a capitalist hellscape
"After watching this cybertruck ad disguised a s a 'review', people should go watch Drew Gooden's video about how dumb cars have become (and how the cybertruck is the posterchild of this trend)"
Best video you‚Äôve ever done üëå
The question is what would have happened if the Cybertruck were not limited to 114 MPH?
It's so dumb...
""
Ill take my 2004 Dodge dakota over a cybertruck everyday
Watching this after having watched Drew Gooden's car video makes me feel a little deceived since you glossed over all of the problems with the cybertruck
If I was Fisker rn I'd be suing the shit out of this guy. Leaving a massively negative review of the competition while getting free cyber trucks directly from tesla? Basically making an advertisement for the horrible cybertruck while tanking the competition's company?
How bias is this guy. Look at the ugly truck and he can't decide if it's good looking or not. No objectivity. üòÇüòÇ

"I had a hire car in the USA in 2001, a Pontiac Aztek, and just as many people approached me back then, even shouting ""I love your car!"" at the traffic lights. Everything that is extraordinary (whether new, old, rare or custom) attracts attention. ""'Towing', 'transporting' and 'off-roading' (...)"" - This is a sobering assessment of how useful a car like this really is, which will probably only be used as a means of transport by the millions of pre-orderers. ""And that's ok."" Why criticise when there's actually nothing to criticise? A big truck with a trailer is also not suitable for picking up your child from school or driving to the supermarket to do the shopping, but it's OK! Of course 'freedom' is ok and the fascination of possibilities, but if you also consider other 'iconic' features as a selling point (shockproof, bulletproof), do US-Americans have to survive everywhere like in 'Escape from New York'?! Also no crumple zone - so me first even if I'm at fault in an accident, even then - that can really hurt.
Don't get me wrong, I think it's cool and I'd love to drive and own one, but it's just nonsensical. For at least 99% of buyers, there is no real reason to own this car. Innovation or not. I know it's difficult to communicate this to US-Americans..."
"Everyone's excessive hate of this vehicle online is just so odd. It's just a vehicle. I don't know if I like it or not, but I'm not going to judge a vehicle before I even drive it. And as far as truck stuff everyone shopping these knows it's not good for full size gas powered truck stuff, or at least I hope so."
an iconic failure indeed
If you bought a cybertruck and wrapped it in vinyl to promote your brand that would be some relatively cheap and effective marketing. I live in LA and I've had maybe half a dozen sightings over the last couple months but nobody has thought of that??
For we in Europe will be really rare for a long time! (They don‚Äôt sell it here)
"Electric trucks are great at towing, just not over long distances.  In town, they're excellent."
"""If you can, from stoplight to stoplight, be just as quick as basically any other  car in a 7,000 pound truck,  that's incredible, that's hilarious, that's really fun.""
No, that's terrifying, that's dangerous, and that's really stupid. A joke on wheels turning heads doesn't make it ""iconic."" Look, I've only just recently come across this channel, but this video has me hitting the ""don't recommend this channel"" button."
"A none Stck Porsche vs a Restricted Cyber Truck ..these results could be different ,lol."

Hard to believe Marques anymore because this truck is a piece of junk.
"im not a fan of tesla but as a cyclist im happy about every person not driving a gas fueled car, with exhaust fumes that are killing me while cycling in the city."
"Based on several other reviews on this thing you were way to easy on it. You almost completely ignored its safety issues and despite your statistics showing most people that buy trucks don't use them for truck stuff, that shouldn't give it a pass in how terrible it is for truck stuff. This thing has been shown to be horrible for towing or hauling over even moderate distances and only comes in a bed variation so small you can fit almost nothing in it. I'm glad you pointed out some of the problems that come from the lack of physical controls in vehicles however, that trend is absolutely horrible and a major safety problem."
"Marques, I love your videos and I‚Äôve grown up watching them! The writing, the music, and the cinematography is amazing. 
But I can‚Äôt help but notice your avoidance to talk about the real safety issues of the Cyber truck, in more detail.  To claim that people‚Äôs reaction or how they drive around you is the real safety hazard seems a little tone deaf. I also wonder at what point it is large creator‚Äôs responsibility to talk about the large civic injustice that occur for our technology to be made? You may have talked about this in other videos but, all I could think of while watching this was the cobalt miners in Congo who work in unsafe conditions, to create cool tech we own and review."
big electric cars just dont make that much sense....the battery weighs 3 times as much as the big model 3 one but only gets around 50% range because its double total weight......
Thanks!
"Yeah the way it makes other people behave has nothing to do with how it blinds them. Or all the other issues, that we can see it has very bad viewer angles.
That we know many big cars SUV has huge issues with outward vision area. And this car even more.
I don't know what it is but this seems a Amway to again trying to shift the blame away from a very ill designed car with a huge amount of hazardous errors and bad design.

No its all the other drivers.
Also here is another thought.
The amount of many design flaws , ACCUMULATES to make it much much worse.
The way you've start you carelessly redirects from the flaws as if they can be dismissed one by one.
Showing you have no concept or idea or what makes something bad or Ill designed or many other things.

Again excuses for Tesla and seemingly anything Elon Musk works on, when repeatedly the my make mistakes in a large number of things that are well-known within car design and construction knowledge and shouldn't happen so frequently and in so many numbers.
All companies will make errors and almost all cars will have some flaws that could have been avoided.
But the sheer size and amount that Tesla does is staggering, and we have a tech section that again and again comes with justifications and excuses, and when they do that they make our roads more unsafe , and let them off the hook."
"First video in a long time that I hit that dislike button on. Marques is trying so hard not to mention negatives, dance around previously mentioned points and doing his best to stay on course. Course being a promotion of this absurd, badly manufactured, unsafe vehicle.
Iconic doesn't mean rare. Iconic also doesn't mean good. This is a bad car."
"Being iconic doesn't mean being good. This car is a bad joke in almost all aspects. As a EU guy I can only watch, and laugh in disbelief, how America is becoming more and more absurd. This poor excuse of a car is legal to own? Remember US banning pop-up headlights because of ""pedestrian safety""? Yeah.
Quo vadis 'Murica?"
Miles = The Stig....?
"so, no mentioning that the body of the car being of a harder, non-bending metal actually makes the shockwaves of impact propagate directly to the occupants without any dampening, making collisions way riskier to the life of who's inside?
EDIT: of course not, you even lie a little bit. hope the youtube adsense + tesla money transfer are  enough to pay your priest for forgiveness"
"I posted a comment on his new video ""There is something ingenuine about Disney and Marquez that makes this collaboration complete"" but can say this about him and Tesla too. Does Elon pay well to be a Tesla fanboy?"
All the pedestrians getting sliced in half by this thing are gonna be hella iconic

"I just can't get past this thing not having door handles.  This is a huge security risk if someone ever slipped off the road into a body of water, right?  How would anyone rescue you?"
The only opinion that matters is yours.
"Some people probably love it. There is literally nothing that appeals to me about it. But more than that...if I wanted a truck...an actual truck...to do truck things with, this would be the last thing I would consider."
"This truck is like the new hummer. Garbage vehicle that‚Äôs too expensive, but douchebags will still get it so they can run you off the road."
"The Cyberjoke is ugly, and only a tool would drive one"
"It is definitely an SUV. The word ""truck"" is just a marketing thing. It is amazing how you can get people to imagine things that aren't there. F150, I still love you :)."
"I live in a area with a lot of rich ppl, I‚Äôm not excited for my schools parking lot to have some of these üò≠ some kid already drives a ev hummer and has almost ran me over twice. I drive my tiny Hyundai accent and am terrified of these massive cars."

Seen it in person and definitely was not impressed.
"Thank you for the explanation on the quick vs fast, hope more people will understand the difference."
So many issues with this vehicle. It is not even a truck. It gets beat by a suburb off roading. Rust on panels already. It's a joke.
8.7% Dislikes on this video with 3.2M Views...wonder what that means?
The finish is so so bad.
"Iconic, like Trump's hair. 
Doesn't mean it's a good thing."
"Okay, how smart is this guy?üî•üî•"
"I had the first Rivian in my state (literally) and the amount of people who would speed up, block me in, take pictures/videos while driving a hwy speeds, swerve into my lane, and overall just act dumb around the truck was insane. It's not just the cybertruck, its any unique looking vehicle. This would also happen early in the Model S and X lifecycle when I had those."
Can't believe he went with the Back To The Future Guitar Solo argument to defend this meme on wheels.
Waiting for MKBHD to make it Matte Black.
The cyber truck looks absolutely fuckin terrible. Pure garbage
"The fact that if you want to wash the truck and you forget to put it in ""car wash"" mode it completely destroys the truck and isn't covered by the warranty is beyond laughable"
"Man, this is a straing up Tesla/Elon commercial!"
"I'm sorry but what is the fuction of a review like this, just seems like part flex, part hey I'm the tech guy and this tech is cool, sorta? It sucks as a car, it sucks as a truck. There's no reason for most people to have this. It's unsafe for other drivers and pedestrians, especially since its a very fast and rigid structure. It's way overpriced. Also, you're filling the pockets of a white-supremacist. Don't think iconic is the correct word, more like infamous."
"I'm having trouble deciding if it's more or less responsible to review the Cybertruck with or without discussing Elon Musk's problematic socio-political issues. Like the increase of hate speech on Twitter and his denial of it, his friendly relations w/ white supremecists, or his near unlimited entanglement w/ the Chinese Communist Party. Speaking from the perspective of somebody who USED TO BE a fan of Elon Musk, I feel I should point out that the reason I would give a thumbs down to a Cybertruck isn't that its not interesting or even good looking, but that I can't support a man like Elon Musk. When I see a cyber truck on the street, I assume it belongs to a Musk fanboy, who likes supporting the man who made it, and the things he stands for."
"its a bad and dangerous car, no idea how this is legal in the US. This video seems not complete, what about the rust issues, gaspedal issue, truck not working after couple of miles? Why not try to go offroad (never seen a video where the cybertruck works ANY better than a normal car offroad)"
"I found it a bit problematic, that you looked at it more one sighted. The interior is in a very low quality style, the steal gets dirty and rusty very easily and buyers have a lot of restrictions with how to clean it and how often. There are examples, that already show problems with the steal after 11 days. Furthermore i would have liked if you could have showed the dangers of the car (sensors of trunk dont work, means that if fingers are in they are off; the edges at the doors are very sharp; if you run over someone they are most likely dead). Still good video, thanks for the content.‚ù§"
"Iconic in a sense that the design stands out, yes. But I think for all the wrong reasons. Its a SUV in a shape of a truck (because its bad at everything that a truck should do), it has shoddy build quality (just look at the discolered doors - that can't be intentional), almost all controls are on the touch screen making it very distracing for the driver to use. And thats all aside from the design, which is controverial and I peronally don't like it, but I can see how somebody else can like it, even if its just for the novelty.
So I all you want is essentially a SUV with a extravagant design and care more about how you are seen on the road than what the car actually does for you, its the car for you."
But can it handle car washes?
"These have proven to be unreliable, crappy build quality, low resale value,  un-practical and poorly made machines with lots of problems. Iconic!! My son's drawing would then be a master piece. Why is he promoting this shit again an again!"
"Iconic for being the worst ‚Äú truck‚Äù ever built? Sure and that‚Äôs about it, but glad to see you are still selling out for checks."
This tells me everything about the state of marques now. What a complete sellout.
Very wholesome for Marqes to show his child
"That‚Äôs just the copium. It‚Äôll wear off. But no, it‚Äôs not iconic, unless it becomes iconic for kluges."
"For a channel that's recently under fire for being ""too critical"" of a product, this review seems oddly... biased?"
Why are you wasting time talking about this stupid thing ? Can you imagine the  damage these things are doing to the environment? Why do people need a truck for normal every day use? How stupid must one be to even think of buying this ?
"This additide of willing beta tester is really messed up. It's a car. Its a massive peice of steel traveling at high speeds, from the testing thats out and the recall thats in it shouldn't of been legal. That self closeing trunk could easily remove fingers or a hand, and the gas pedal was held on by a plastic clip. You cannot beta test on the general public with a car."
One of the biggest things it has going for it in terms of actual utility and tangible capabilities that differentiate it from other vehicles is actually the bed and cover so I'm disappointed to see that omitted.

"Look, I am really sorry: If I wanna have stainless steel, black plastic I would buy a DeLorean."
I think this truck looks awesome
he said it had low headlights that arent in peoples eyes but i swear i literally watched a video yesterday bringing up how they shine in everyones eyes at night
If you didn‚Äôt come from the Milkstreet raise your hand
How do you hook up the horse trailer?
The millions of people who are gonna use this truck eventually?! man i hope not!
"I am happy its not allowed in EU.

"I don't hate the back, and I don't not like the front, but the side is weird to me.  The way that line is closer to the front wheel arch than the back just looks odd to me.

Also I know that Tesla know who they are selling to, but you'll never see one of these with a cherry picker boom arm in the back, and you'll never see one in the frozen areas of the planet because touch screens don't work with thick gloves"
How do you have two
Sharp!!
Prefer the Porsche.
This truck is having so many issues that any reviewer trying to smooth over this catastrophic failure has lost all credibility.
nah
ugly unsafe car that shouldn't be allowed on public roads
"14:36 Any reason you took so long off the mark, MKBHD? Is this your way of making things ""interesting""? By taking what looks like a few hundred milliseconds AFTER the Cybertruck before accelerating from a STOP?"
"8:54 You called the Fisker the worst car you've ever reviewed but here show that Tesla, one of the most famous/infamous car companies in the world, screwed up the door latch? Did anything about the Fisker start falling apart there, Marques? ""Already Iconic""? Yeah, of Elon Musk, his arrogance, and his inability to come up with the goods. I hope you keep this video up, MKBHD. When these over-priced loser-mobiles look like they belong in a post-apocalyptic trash heap, you may be the worst-reviewed reviewer that people ever heard of. Congratulations!"
"It changes your steering based on your speed? That sounds DANGEROUS. The steering responsiveness or the ratio of steering wheel to steering the wheels should NOT change. Does it change the braking too? How about the accelerator? Maybe the headlights auto-adjust, too. I think Musk/Tesla is trying too hard to automate things BEFORE they can be automated RESPONSIBLY. This isn't a phone or a new way of making fruit smoothies. Cars and trucks are HEAVY MACHINERY, and if they don't respond PREDICTABLY, someone could get seriously hurt or die."
This... thing... is iconic of Elon Musk's arrogance and how much it's going to cost Tesla forever. Are you really boosting this cheesy rustbucket? It looks like something they had to throw out after making some stupid sci-fi.
Just saw one of these in Saint Louis and was so confused at what I saw lmao
The stark contrast between this review and Fisker's review is kinda sus. Very curious how a review of BYD would pan out on this channel
"What that person said about the TP Loser is ABSOLUTELY FALSE. If they were talking about the Prowler, that would be true. The Prowler looks like an alien spaceship still today. Hell, a 1998 Viper still turns heads. But the PT Snoozer? Never on its best day would anyone EVER take a beat to acknowledge its presence. That person's opinion is factually incorrect."
Looks like an suv
Ugliest thing they made yet lol.
"I'd never buy this, and overall if someone wants to buy it I also don't care. It's actually great, because it tells me a lot about that person. So if for example I have a friend who buys one, I now know to never lend them money, because they have poor financial literacy."
"Damn these videos, so good."
That thing is ü§Æ
"It's so true that this thing gets attention. I have seen a Cybertruck exactly once and sure enough, I ogled it at the gas station and ended up having a conversation with the owner and taking photos with my family."
Okay.. so what happens to other people you hit? They just die?
You can't rationalize that crazy shape away.
You haven't seen road hostility until you've driven a Prius.
"The Cybertruck even being in the ballpark of a 911 is insane considering its size and weight. But it BEATS the 911 at 0-60, the speeds that matter to typical drivers on typical roads. That's underrated performance. Losing to a 911 at 80+ mph is irrelevant."
This is more of an advertisement than an unbiased review.
"I feel like people who like this truck dont realize how bad it will be for people walking in cities. When he brings up one person vs 4 people being unhappy to happy, hes not recognizing the context of people who dont have to worry about the car vs people who are in a box of steel. I wont budge in thinking high speed+high traction is terrible. That will eat through our already damaged road and nkt to mention people being destracted by a screen in a 3 ton vehicle is literally a recipe for disaster.  Genuinely hate this truck as someone who already has to deal with trucks that cant see above my 6'3"" head"
"I still think ZZ Top made the PT Cruiser as popular as it became. Not that they endorsed the car in any way, it was just how iconic their own logo with that vehicle style was. Had a mobster, 30s 40s feel to it that was the initial attraction. Should have had suicide doors, imo."
Toyota/Lexus already had full steer-by-wire without a physical connection since last year or so
"Holy shit, is that The Stig?"
You spelled _moronic_ wrong in the thumbnail title
Interesting how this guy is OK with all the bugs and negatives about the cyber truck including a safety recall for all of them.  But he basically destroyed Fisker in their infancy over software bugs.  How much was he paid?  Hmmmm.  We'll never know.
"Wait so - after a year if you have a negative kWh credit - it just..... vanishes into the aether? You get paid our nothing? You function like a tiny power plant for the company but you don't get paid the overproduction. (Clearly not at the price they are selling you a kwh but say at 30% of the hour) 
That sucks. Cause that's a thing here in Austria."
I like your approach and methodology in sharing your assessment and perceptions about ‚Äúcars‚Äù. You will do well in this role!
"Well, well, well fingerprint magnet and not carwash capable huh? Bad combination."
"the fact that safety concerns weren't brough up about poor crumple zones, doors that can maim you, how much momentum it carries, so that anyone hit by the truck would suffer much more damage than a standard truck?"
"5:00 Wait, so half a turn of the steering wheel will result in different reaction at low speeds vs high speeds?
Am I understanding this correctly?
Because it sounds really, REALLY fucking stupid."
Let's not forget that a real vehicle..  or any other NOT EV vehicle.... In 5 years it will still work perfectly fine ..... Damn!!.. There are car from the 1940's that even today work fine...... now this battery toy??.. In 5 years it will have 50% battery capacity if you are lucky....... or your tell me.. your 5 year old cell phone or lithium battery drill still holds full charge in his battery???... and by the way most of us.. in 5 years we will be still paying for the damn car..

Nice review MB!
"They left a lot of room for improvement. Watch every few months as new trucks come on the market. I‚Äôm expecting a year from now you get a substantially different truck. Two years from now, who knows? Sky is the limit. 

You are right, a mass produced vehicle will look different when they are everywhere. They might start to look like clones in those science fiction flicks. But . . . I have the feeling it won‚Äôt go this way with the Cybertruck. Or Tesla cars generally. Enough will be customized with wraps and accessories they won‚Äôt blend in like a bison in a herd numbered in the millions. But speculating is part of the journey."
"The stainless steel. You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs overrated having bulletproof panels, bulletproof glass. But  Navigators and other vehicles do get upgraded to bulletproof (for a big fee) by custom shops. And in one of the Munro Live videos shared how they started with 3mm thick body panels, then switched to thinner metal, saying they changed the alloy so they had the same durability that weighs and costs less. But I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt mind slightly lowering the bulletproof-ness. It makes no sense to invite people to shoot at your truck."
Nothing says you went to public school like driving a car for attention
"Should I wait for the $25,000 Tesla?"
Ik the cartel is gonna use this cause of the bulletproof steel and the storage
6:44 Brownlee is not a small guy. But the Cybertruck sure makes him look like one. Wow.
"The guy who thumbed down you probably irrationally hates Elon. Most people who hate him literally have no reason, are misinformed, and are irrational. Elon could create nuclear fission and take us to the moon and Mars, and there would still be people shit-talking him and irrationally hating him."
A car you love but you think you can't buy because you don't want to be robbed.
"My question is where the fuck are my pop up headlights in new cars? They obviously didn't actually think the ""sharp"" corners that pop up headlights create were dangerous since this piece of shit exists. So whats the real reason they are gone.

Also i like Ev's, I'm all for ev's, the hummer ev is the coolest shit imo even tho i acknoledge it's a waste of resources, i have wanted a toyota prius since i was like 9 so 11 years ago at this point. I don't mind tesla at all. Its literally just this truck is god awful."
"You can tell Marquise isn‚Äôt really a car guy. History is littered with iconic, mass-produced cars: Mustang, Beetle, Audi TT, 911, 356 to name just a few"
Love your reviews
"if the icon is of a shallow human with dispensable income, then yes, yes it is iconic"
People who think it's weird that  some people have never heard of Cybertruck don't realize that most people don't live on the internet...
Minecraft the car - best features are the recall; and car wash mode or bust.
long ago I remember I think mazda came to my school with w drawing competition for a new car idea and i drew a car for them and turned it in and it basically looked like this
"Brother said, ""...it's giving dump truck vibes."" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Beta and Alpha testing is not allowed for any other car manufacturers fyi
it won't look so great when it rusts in less than 30 days because they don't treat the steel
Good Job Sir.
"Awesome, You was at Island dragway, NJ"
Glad I live in Europe where this will never be allowed on the road
Don't pull into a car wash anytime soon.
"It's literally a meme car for YouTubers and other people with more money than sense. Nobody who actually cares about value for money would buy it. 
It not even likely to be street legal in large parts of the world."
its more like trash
You have millions of subs isn‚Äôt that your regular driving experience
Can the Cybertruck be bought outside he USA?
"Maybe being a YouTuber with 19 million subs affects how people look at you.

Just a little."
Most iconic thing about this vehicle is steering failing just after 14 days of delivery. What a POS.
What's iconic about it the truck doesn't do anything they said it would do and if you do wanted to do that you gotta pay extra the truck isn't really bulletproof in order to be bulletproof you have to be able to stop a 45 caliber and cannot do that it goes through-and-through both doors the truck isn't anything it claimed to be
"iconic? yes, iconically dumb, iconically unpractical, iconically bad."
"I am still so incredibly sceptical about steer by wire. Sure, I love the variable steering rates and the haptic feedback, but what happens when the car is old and it fails. Are you just going to suddenly lose all steering, is the car going to think you‚Äôre doing 20 down the highway and adjust the steering accordingly? At least with a mechanical steering wheel, any failure is likely to be a progressive failure that will give you forewarning."
I disagree about you being fine if you‚Äôre hit. Cars that crumple absorb the energy of the crash. A hard material means the energy is transferred into the passenger.
"Look ma, no hands."
"It‚Äôs like the shudder you get with a tequila shot. So wrong, but somehow so right."
It‚Äôs the BC Rich of cars üòÇ
"Thumbs up for the review (24:10) watched all 27:23 mins of this. I am a bit late (3 weeks later) watching this, but it would be a big surprise to see a Cybertruck on the streets of Jakarta, Indonesia nevertheless I would not rule this out."
"Seems like all I see online (including this comment section, jeeze) is hate for this thing and frankly most EVs... But I think it's cool and innovative. Obviously not for everyone and that's ok, no car is for everyone. I had the pleasure of being taken for a short joy ride in one by a friend of mine who works for Tesla, and holy crap it was cool üòé"
"People calling the Cybertruck ugly has bias against it. People who don't know a thing about Elon, Tesla, and EVs simply find it interesting, like something out of a sci-fi movie. I showed a picture of it to some of my old folks and 4/7 asked if it was a new Batmobile. üòÖ
Not a fan of it myself as I'm more of a Subaru guy but if I see one on the streets, I'd probably take a picture and tell my friend about it. Some folks be hating on other people's cars is stupid."
"yeah, terrible vehicle"
Who is fool enough to buy this car?
"With the amount of gun violence in america, the bullet proof is actually under rated"
dangerous.
It's üóë üöÆ....
This aged like milk. Can we still trust any of your reviews ? Are you just a paid shill for terrible and dysfunctional products ?
Thought you were going to say the accelerator pedal at the beginning.
SCARY drive unless after sunset
Wait is that Fall Out Boy at 3:46 ?
"It's possible to be iconic and mass-produced. The Mini, the VW Golf, even the F150 are all iconic."

"Ok, but i will wait for a NotJustBikes review on the Cybertruck."
"never once in my life i want to take pictures of other people vehicleüòÇi would just look at it,admired it and moved on"
"Idk Mk there's a lot of things that you left out of this review or at least could have mentioned that make it feel like you were intentionally going soft of Tesla for one reason or another:
1. The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).
2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place
3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof
4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.
5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn't at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the ""iconic design"" 
6. For health and safety reasons it is entirely irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors actually are, I have seen videos of carrots getting sliced and chopped against the edges of the door, they're like fucking katanas üòÇ.
Anyway, I hope in a year or so we can get a more well rounded review from you tackling the issues I've just highlighted, especially number 6 because if anyone who owns a toddler has designs on buying this dumb truck, they should at least know that it comes with the possibility of leaving their toddler devoid of a finger or two."
"This thing is dangerous, ugly, and overall unnecessary as it doesn't bring anything new to any market. It's just a funny looking wannabe tank. I understand that you're all about fair reviews and you're looking at the product separate from the manufacturer, but this doesn't need or deserve positive recognition"
Its hideous Its just hyped BS
"I'll be the next cyclist giving you a thumbs down. This truck and others in its class further endanger pedestrians and cyclists, all for ""the design."" It's disappointing seeing someone I look up to praise a trend like this."
"It is iconic, in that it's a marketing gimmick. Unmistakable look that's very eye-catching. To me it honestly just looks like free advertising on four wheels.

But good on them for releasing a concept car into the wild, I'd like to see that more often."
Shout out to the graph in the middle of the video. Finally have something to show the die hard truck buyers when they say im lying about people rarely using a truck for its original intended purpose.
I replayed that intro way too many times. Felt like I was watching an NFS cinematic
Already an iconic meme legend..
"People reporting that they got 2 hours, 2 months, who-knows out of this thing before random problems with the digital electronics bricked it. Starts getting mini-rust stains after a couple hours in rain. No thanks. What a waste."
"Iconic they are already on the recall list, iconic more like ironic."
"I am sad to say I have had to stop watching MKBHDs stuff, I feel he is sadly very out of touch with day to day people along with our horrible economy. And reading the comments, it seems like he was very positive to a ..concerning degree in this video. This truck has an immense amount of problems. I am disappointed."
Sustainability?
I love when you comment on how finger-printy something is. Such a 1st world non-issue to come from years of reviewing cell phones.
üòÇ I thought you were about to pull an AR out of the trunk. ü§£
"A YouTuber complaining that they get talked to by strangers. Sure. I think most people would welcome the attention.

Edit: Sry. Not complaining. Mkbhd is too good a dude to do that (publicly?)."
"1. I think the majority of people taking pictures of the cyber truck does it - not because they think it‚Äôs cool - but because it stands out.

2. I think it‚Äôs the same reason people overestimate the price. They think it‚Äôs a limited run car - which it is because Tesla hasn‚Äôt been able to make more than 4k of them. 

Both of these things will therefore stop happening if the car ever reaches a wider adoption."
"if I had a Cybertrk, first thing I'd do is take it to a shop to have it wrapped in that bedliner shit lmao"
Im pretty sure the most dangerous thing is the faulty accelerator pedal
The Cybertruck will be a collector's item by early 2025 when everyone cancels their orders because it's a $100K disaster.
You are not a car reviewer.  Stick with phones.
"That biker giving you the thumbs down is because they saw the culmination of all the years of 'bigger is better' car designs making the roads less and less safe. I'll take my old VW sedan design any day. There's already too many SUVs around here and it's honestly becoming a problem on the road and in parking lots.
Final verdict on the car is that it's not safe for others and I don't want to see one. The tech and design to make it functional is cool though."
Bulletproof rust.
The scale model of cyber truck is awsome.
Here is the thing that nobody gets: The Cybertruck is a tech demo. Not for consumers but for manufacturing. The Cybertruck is to Model 2 what Model 2 was for Model 3. A more expensive first iteration.
"""Tesla Cybertruck Review: Already Iconic?""

Fisker: ""This is the worst car i have ever reviewed""

No wonder people think you are bias. Imagine thinking Magna Styer produces shittier build quality cars than Tesla. 

Stick to tech dude, this isn't your space."
"I‚Äôd give it a higher score if it didn‚Äôt have that horrible minimalistic interior üòù.  I still find them interesting to see them in the wild. And yeah, Same feeling as the PT Cruiser when I was 12."
"""Millions of people"" will end up with this eventually you say? The recall of every single Cybertruck FORCED Tesla to reveal how many they delivered to date: about 3.5k.  IN TOTAL. So they just need to increase deliveries by a factor of a thousand to reach that number lmao."
"Thank you for not pandering, but telling it like you experience it. These tech companies consider your input on future updates. keep speaking the good word, Marques!"
A massive bulking truck made of steel which is faster than some sports cars and it about to be in the hands of millions of people who have never driven a truck before... sounds like alot of people are going to die.
"man so many people talking shit about this car, but they freak out with joy when they actually see it irl..."

Meh. I‚Äôd be who carew
"Iconic? Yes. 

Ugly ? Also yes."
The Cybertruck is a joke.  It is not really functional AS A REAL PICKUP TRUCK.  It is just a SUV with a weird compartment for a TRUNK (for storage).  I think it will be discontinued within five years.
i think the biker used a thumbs down bc he didn't like the thought of being sliced in half by a cybertruck
I am an ER nurse and bike rider.  I PRAY FOR CYCLISTS.  :(
Think I will stick with my F-150
I don't think the Tesla ad was a cyber truck vs a TURBO Porsche am I wrong? Wasn't it vs a base 911?
Arent cars supposed to crumble on impact to have the car take the force and not the human?  THat seems dangerous with major collisions.
Already Recalled

Just don't wash it on a sunny day....
I want to like this truck so bad... I just don't know though.
iconic for just how bad it is lol
This video seems to be a paid commercial ü§î
Crazy how he's collecting his words and being careful what he says about this truck :)
They do that with Lamborghini. Research better!
Gaff tape holding your $100k car door on is insane and I can‚Äôt believe the video didn‚Äôt stop there. Are you driving on public roads with your driver‚Äôs side door taped closed??
Should have tagged this with ‚ÄúAd‚Äù
It is a unique truck. But it costs twice the price of a Ford Lightning and offers less functionality.
"It's a neat vehicle with all manner of interesting features, but it's not a truck. Having a bed alone doesn't qualify it. It's more of an open air station wagon"
Iconically bad
"Should have included a section on how musk has become a divisive figure in society and that's probably where the thumbs downs are coming from. Personally i would never buy a tesla product, purely because of my thoughts about elon. Enjoyed the review"
You know looking at that truck from the side it kind of looks like it was like a B2 or some kind of stealth vehicle trying to create a low profile or something
Imaging activating 'Elon Mode'.
"There's something gross, almost sinister about promoting impractical vehicles like this that are deadly to pedestrians, weigh a ton (wearing down roads at taxpayer expense and requiring bigger batteries made of rare materials), and take a huge amount of space on our streets in an era of climate crisis and cities trying to be more human friendly. It's supposed to be a truck, but (like a lot of trucks in the US) seems mainly to to be used for grocery shopping by insecure men living in the suburbs. What the hell is the point of very high acceleration in a truck? Are people competing in drag races with these? If not why even talk about stuff like this? What an idiotic, uniquely American vehicle."
Junk vehicle
"The PT was and is Crysler Crap. Ask any mechanic. Lol.

Cybertruck has already had a couple reliability and safety incidents so we will know if this CyberTonkaTruck is Elon's folly or the new benchmark. Hopefully the gaps and pedals can be addressed as it opens the field for competition as welüò¢l."
That thing is the UGLIEST thing on the road!
I don't know if you can really say people's reactions are still the most dangerous thing about the Cyber Truck anymore.
I just got a new crosstrek wilderness and the other day a lady at a red light rolled her window down and pointed her phone camera at my car. I was like ‚Äòyeah you get a good shot of this‚Äô.
"It's robust, it's definitely ultra cool"
"When it comes to Iconic, I ask myself if people are going to fall in love with the vehicle. Not what it represents, but the look of the vehicle itself. For me I think the answer is No. Strip away the novelty of the angles and profiles, and no one 20 years down the line is going to call out the shape of that rear end as their inspiration for a new vehicle. No kid's gonna carry around stats for the Cybertruck in their head. The classics are cars that kids today still long for and dream about when they've seen them. A Countach could come out today and very little about it would be considered behind the times. A Cybertruck is going to look dated fairly quickly imo.

It's gonna be sitting in collections as an oddity for sure, but I have to wonder if all the compromises in the way it's built will mean very many of them are even running 25 years from now."
Its iconic in the same way the poop emoji is an iconic way to illustrate human shit
NaICe
‚ÄúAnd all the redundancies to make it safe‚Äù citation needed
"""Already Iconic?"" Yes. They're iconic because, it is the only milk float, sorry car, that has had all of its production recalled or as Mr Brownlee would have you believe.
It‚Äôs just an aesthetic inconvenience...nothing to see here, move along..plebs."
"15:29 Deutscher Frisbeesport Verband? Willkommen im Team, Bruder!"

What about the rusting issues the cybertrucks are starting to have?
in germany there are already lawsuits because teslas stear by wire caused accidents xD
Sorry...people need their heads read to want one of these.
"@8:08 What do you mean ""one or two years down the road they're making millions of the thing"" ? Don't tell me they hope to attract more than a few Tesla enthusiasts who are rich enough to waste their money on this vehicle.
@7:27 I guess (and fear) that this ""You'll fine"" (bis) means that the person who hit you (or whom you hit) will not be fine. The safety features of a vehicle are here to minimise damages (to other vehicles and to human beings).
@13:24 ""Next category: performance."" Then, proceed to talk about one specific type of performance : pure speed and acceleration. What about road handling abilities, car range, etc... ? Speed is seriously the least of my concerns as a driver."
The fact this car is legal (and not regulated out of existence) is proof our government has failed us.
"Comparing that Tesla thing to a PT Cruiser (Dodge Neon underpinnings) with a $16K base price to a ""Cybertruck"" @ $60K to $100K is a bit of a stretch when comparing potential mass sales.  The biggest potential problem is the owner of the company.  Nothing that man says can be trusted.  The vehicle may have some fetching features BUT latching hardware falling off?  Not good.  Recall of 100% of these trucks due to accelerator pedal experiencing rapid unscheduled disassembly (thankfully unlike the SpaceX RUD it truck doesn't blow up it just falls apart).  Marques, you didn't mention the rusty ""stainless"".  How long will you wait to get these damn things repaired?  In the past the wait was horrendous.  Marques, I hope you enjoy carefree miles in your new ride but I think you have been too kind to a problematic manufacturer.

Before you attribute this to ""teething problems"", German Teslas were experiencing much higher that typical failure to pass inspection just three years after purchase.  Good luck to anybody that buys a Tesla."
There is so much he brings to the review that just a review
I've seen one in Dallas. It is hideous and ridiculous. I want to how much Elon paid you for this video because NO...... I didn't stare at it and I didn't take a picture of it.  I laughed and said a fool parted with his money.
"I don't know having your accelerator pedal break. Mid drive and be stuck on full throttle because of its poor, build quality seems pretty dangerous to me."
"And omg, yaw isn't what you think it is. We can't be taking a tech influencer as a car reviewer now"
Is this an ad ?
"So much for objectivity, lol. You just made a clarification video about humane and Fisker, there's a marked personal bias in favor and occasionally against brands that contradicts that video. Don't call yourself a reviewer please, be the influencer you are."
Ugly. Waste of money
Im pretty sure most people that see that like myself go holy fuck thats ugly i cant believe somebody bought one of those. Is that even a real cybertruck that shit looks like a knockoff . Imma take a picture.
Ha recalled!
"Question, is this a better car? No, then why tf did you buy it? Cause you have money to burn nice..."
GG good review as always enjoy watching the recall
"Marques isn't your 911 a ""Turbo s."""
Nothing wrong with just driving your truck on the street. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise.
"Honestly I forget that truck exists until I see them every once in a while. But it does remind me of the the El Camino. Aside from that I don‚Äôt have much else to say, tho it is huge."
Ouchie. Recall incoming.
"I genuinely like the look. 

What I don‚Äôt like is the truck not ‚Äúworking‚Äù and the right way and issues. Like come on it shouldn‚Äôt have taken this long for a truck to be made with all the tech we have."
With that wonky accelerator it‚Äôs probably not wise to drive and film / keep looking at the camera. You‚Äôll be safe ‚Äî encased in steel ‚Äî but maybe not the other driver / pedestrian  in the accident.
"Usually, I can understand people shilling for corporation and billionaires. Easy money, and you don't have to do anything besides latching onto them like a parasite. But supporting anything that Elon Musk does is like supporting Ted Faro from Horizon games... detrimental to everyone in a long term. I was at least expecting neutral-adjacent review, not a promo for this useless shoddily built toy pretending to a truck."
It‚Äôs ugly.

The most ugliest truck ever designed.  Whoever bought it must have distaste in beauty
"The design is futuristic for a 1982 cyberpunk artist. It's not futuristic now. It's nostalgia for kids from the 70s and 80s. I think once that initial wave of nostalgia passes and it just exists for a while, the dropoff will be sharp."
Recall video when?
The Cybertruck did the impossible. It made the Honda Ridgeline look more like a truck.
an icon of bad product
"Just a few more years left till bankruptcy, Musky baby"
"I think he glossed over the safety a bit too fast. I have seen the crash test video, and I don't think you, the driver, will be fine either. And since the people outside definitely won't be fine also, you may want to be extra insured."
So how rusty is it with all the steel around?
0:39 Whats wrong with people.
Adaptive steering? Drive by wire? That's not new. That has been in cars for years.
üëç‚ù§üëç
Iconic because of the recall isn't it? who says you can't monetize controversy... Elon's been doing it all his life... i hear all 3000 cybertrucks were just recalled for that potentially lethal accelerator pad fail....
Thank you.
Said it once I‚Äôll say it twice‚Ä¶ iconic‚Ä¶for its flaws‚Ä¶ you are too charitable to this brand‚Ä¶
"I feel compelled to say: That's a SUPERB video, my friend. Not to put down anything you'd ever done, but compared to the many electronics vids I watched way back, this is WOW!  Everything from audio quality to image composition, script, creativity, e.g. the clever guessing game - over or under-rated? - the race, and its unexpected curveball - almost hijack - introduction, all captivating. I intended to watch something else, but instead sat forward, glued to every second of this piece. Proves how a YT video can be valuable, informative, entertainment. Thanks a million, I'm so glad I've subscribed."
Already recalled
"All cyber trucks on US roads got recalled, i wonder if he returned his cyber truck to get fixed"
understood his level of commitment to tesla when he said tesla might be first to give steer by wire. Steer by wire exist long before even he or me was born and tesla isn‚Äôt the first to implement even google can tell this. I like your honest reviews about products but this video seems to be contradict.
Iconic as the Edsel
The words Cyber and Truck don't go alongü§∑üèª
HA I definitely saw you out in the city the other day drove straight pass me. An I couldn't believe how BIG this truck was ! It was amazingly futuristic !
the black plague is also iconic
"Eh, I disagree with the whole ethos of driving oversized, overpowered vehicles just because one can. If that thing hits my little Chevy Bolt, I and my kid are probably dead, or wishing we were. Essentially we're creating a vehicular arms race where buying a bigger car is as much a self defense consideration as it is anything else. Not great for the environment, if that's one's reason for buying an EV (which it very well may not be, I'm not naive...)."

Great review! Love your content Marques. Keep up the good work!
So 4.5 months since its launch and they don‚Äôt even have 4000 ‚Äútrucks‚Äù on the road. Thats a massive failure for Elon. Either they can‚Äôt make them or people are not buying them. Either way way they are losing money for a production line that can only produce 1/2 of Tacomas sold in 1 months. Think about that. Toyota sells 8000 Tacomas in 1 month and it took 4.5 months for Tesla to get 3787 cybertrucks out the door. That‚Äôs a massive failure that he created. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You mean Moronic?
Cybertrucks are garbage and getting recalled right now
Can a Cyber truck beat a 911 on Willow Springs?... probably note... Silverstone? Probably not. De la Sarthe? Probably not but certainly not in a 24 hr race.
"I cant get over the feeling this is just a gimmicky looking, shoddily put together toaster. To me it's iconic for all the wrong reasons."
I think the cybertruck will get reactions regardless of production. People still freak out when I open my falcon wing door on my X.

"Now, you can add a stuck accelerator pedal, which has prompted a recall of over 3,500 vehicles. This is a novelty now, but it will cause an accident due to the distraction it causes others. This car is UGLY and has no practicality."
Total recall
"It's the most stupic car design ever, like a kid drew it. It does not work as a truck because you can hardly use the bed, it does not work off road and it has serious build issues. And It won't be allowed into in most countries outside the US because of the sharp edges."

"Curious if anyone has considered the fact you can steal someone's fingerprints from a Cybertruck if you don't clean them off immediately... Couldn't possibly be a risk of any kind, lol

Also, not bulletproof. On that topic, 9mm is a tiny pistol round. Below that you have essential a .22, .32 and .38 caliber... hardly anything crazy. This POS would never stop a rifle round, and repeated impacts from a pistol or SMG in the same area would stress the stainless enough to split it easily

Final point... just get a socket set and tighten the damn door latch... seriously. You really don't need a service appointment to tighten a few bolts"
Ha-ha!
"Iconic like a Delorean but not cool...all the gushing and like major design flaws, 100k junk.  Why do people fall for the lies"
"you could easily call the Pacer & Pinto ""iconic""...."
"As an European citizen I think who have decided to buy this truck it‚Äôs just insane and very probably an asshole. It would be perfect to create law that limits the dimension of cars for who have to go only to the grocery store. Less waste, less danger, less space needed, but no, America it‚Äôs about freedom! Same for guns and single housing system. 
Btw I love many things about America, but for these reasons and many others I‚Äôm happy to be European."
"No offence dude, but this was not good. You ignored all the major issues and brushed off a bunch of others.

I only recently found your channel and was thinking ‚Äúwoah, this guy is really honest and trustworthy with his reviews!‚Äù. 

However, now I‚Äôve seen this, I am questioning if I can trust everything you said in your other reviews‚Ä¶

Do you really want to ruin your reputation as an honest reviewer over this thing?"
"VW Beetle (K√§fer), Citroen 2CV, Opel Manta, Trabant, ... so many mainstream cars that are iconic."
"""Cybertruck: A bold leap into the future or a design misstep? While some hail its innovative approach, others question its practicality and aesthetics. Love it or hate it, Tesla's Cybertruck has certainly sparked conversation about the future of automotive design."""
Thank god that this dangerous monstrosity will never be sold outside the US.
"Few points - it‚Äôs not that practical, quality severely is lacking, certain design choices are absolutely mind boggling. And it‚Äôs not cheap at all. Those ‚Äúqualities‚Äù will prevail so as production ramps up and won‚Äôt be unique anymore price will plummet no doubt. I would think second hand owner market is much more sensible and chooses based on those qualities not some temporal celebrity fad. This car will age terribly, and maintenance will be very costly. It‚Äôs like owning used Range Rover - you know it‚Äôll break, you know it‚Äôll be costly but at least you get luxury. Cybertruck? Don‚Äôt think so."
Worst ever
This fanboy can't save TSLA and APPL from going down LOL
"It's been 3 weeks away from release, the novelty is gone. You're sitting at a red light. You try to convince yourself that it's fine, but the gaps in the doors look off + the rust on the front of the car won't go away.

You think you saw a group of teenagers make fun of you earlier that day. You're now 100 000 dollars in debt for a meme, and you feel... Nothing."
This vehicle is an unmitigated disaster.
Bro I have seen 10 in the last week ü´•
Seen a few. This is the dumbest looking piece of metal on the road. I‚Äôll be glad when they are gone.
Quick vs fast is a great analogy.
"Knowing how Elon runs his businesses I would never trust that steering wheel, one minor bug in the sensors/code that thing uses and a lane change at 70mph could turn into you doing a 90 degree turn and flipping"
"I‚Äôve seen one a few times where I live in FL. Head turning, but I won‚Äôt give up my 99‚Äô 7.3 for one. Salute to Elon Musk. It may be ugly but dude is changing the world all because of his imagination."
"As someone learning to drive as an adult having only ever driven cars in video games, I wish that every car had a steer-by-wire system like this. Having to crank the wheel around multiple times just to turn at low speeds feels like the most unintuitive goddamn thing ever."
Bro that truck is beautiful. I thought it was crappy at first but after seeing it in real life and sitting in the driver seat it‚Äôs a god damn space ship.
Things are dangerous.
"Im just loving the visual of this video. Really an awesome review as well, as per usual!"
yap yap
The definition of living under a rock is never hearing about the cyber truck
Do iconic items rust when left out in the rain?
To me it looks like it could killl pedestrians at low speeds.
Its just ugly. I used to draw cars like that in school when bored :D
Ugliest truck I‚Äôve ever seen
12:33 can someone explain to my why people should air down the tires?
I have a 2008 alpha hummer üòÇ it‚Äôs called a truck ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ÄúThe headlights stay out of people‚Äôs eyes‚Äù
Sorry but it feels like a commercial
I like it manly it reminds me of Total recall from the 1990 !
"After seeing it a few times in public. I believe it is pretty ugly. It is like the DeLorean 2.0 at this point though, so yeah, it is iconic, but it isn't pretty. It has a lot of hype behind it, so it will probably sell well despite its questionable look."
honest review. Thank you
"The only people that aren't morons buying this car are rich people. For everyone else the cybertruck would be a monumentally moronic purchasing decision. Imagine trying to get anything repaired on this car. No one will want to touch it. You're stuck with your ""dealer"" Tesla every single time. Insurance must cost an arm and a leg as well."
Subscribed ! Great video !
"Cybertruck is dope. Heard it rusts easily tho, very curious if that‚Äôs a rumor or not."
Tesla's designs and QA just don't do it for me. Really hoping Toyota/Lexus pull the trigger on their electric line up. Their electric sports cars they revealed a while back looked amazing!
You selling chevron hoodies and getting free 991 just sold yourself on being a propaganda machine for big oils. Your review loses credibility.‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
"This is so called a beauty at the second sight. The more I look at it, the more I like it."
"Marques is bought and paid for by Tesla. I am saying this as a Tesla owner myself , but the Cybertruck is a POS."
The Emperor has no clothes.
"yep bullet proof, rusting issue, lets not talk about that"
I‚Äôm sorry it trash üöÆ it‚Äôs the Meme Stock of cars LOL üòÇ
Try driving a DeLorean
13:55 Ok that was pretty epic lol. The kinda things reviewers should do if they have money to flex.
"Marques' attempt to remain fair and balanced while reviewing Tesla products is really frustrating. Sure, it may be a decent product, but it seems like 95% of people who ordered one, haven't gotten one or haven't gotten what they ordered. Let's not bring the Roadster into this either. And let's not forget the ever-growing number of issues that Tesla seem to experience."
Can‚Äôt wait until we have a bunch of these steel tanks flying around at performance car speeds. Seems like a great idea
I personally like the PS1 graphics of the cybertruck
It will wear off. Just give it some time. Eventually people will drive by without batting an eye
"If I had one, I would paint it black."
Please tell us your opinion for a truck. You seem to have so much proficient knowledge...
this is basically a car out of draw distance
Outro was sick
I have definitely seen at least 10-15 cybertrucks in the last month. No Veyrons or Countachs lol.
Come on M. Can you imagine the usecase for bulletproof windows? How about robbery when you park it in a lot of US locations?
"Infiniti has done a few vehicles with steer by wire, fyi"
"So a review of a stainless steel truck from a guy who can afford to have some slave wage labourers spot cleaning it for him after every drive seems, welp, kinda irrelevant to my life, to be honest.  Don‚Äôt know about all you giga chads, but yeah, just saying‚Ä¶"
Lexus was the first to get steer by wire right. Not Tesla.
Dump truck vibes. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Your opening statement couldn't be more wrong.  LMAO.
0:40 those guys üòÜ
"Give me a Porsche GT3RS, Targa 4S, or Turbo S over Tesla‚Äôs garbage ANYDAY.  

Marques, did you test out the Targa 4S when you got your Turbo S? I know it‚Äôs cold out here in NJ, but I‚Äôm just curious."
I wonder how much MKB got paid for this ad.
I am wondering if this is a paid ad directly from Elon. This video is worth at least $5 million. MKB throws in some downsides to sound objective.
4:43 Mmmm... I think the first steer-by-wire was the Infiniti Q50.
It makes you a automatic 100k memeüòÇ
I'm disappointed in this review man.
"if the $700 AI pin was made by Tesla, Brownlee wouldn't have said it was the worst product he has ever reviewed.

elon has him in his pocket."
"As a seasoned industrial designer (product, manufacturing, plastics) I can tell you this is just a genX fever dream. Dieter Rams enlists 10 design principles of which one of them is ""Good Design is as little design as posible"", now you could say it is all flats surfaces so, ""little desgin was used so therefore is good"" but you are completely forgetting the other 9 points (google them). Pedestrians or other cars... fuck them lets place a sharp battering ram on super fast motors and lets make it heavy AF just beacuse we can and we will add (now deadly) autopilot because fuck you and if you cant get away from this death trap fuck you some more for being a poor AF bastard. Humanity is done people, collect your chips now, make that trip, fuck that bitch, own that shit."
"This guy is simping hard for Elon. He was probably paid for this good review. I refuse to believe he truly thinks this truck is worth 100k with all of the bad programming, build design flaws, and plastic accelerator / break pedal covers that pop off and get stuck under said pedals."
omg those window streaks/scratches are killing me
Pretty cool futurestic
üëΩüí∞üí∞üëΩ
üëç
It all fun and games until that crappy accelerator pedal gets stuck and sends you on a high-speed death ride!!
Wouldn't its exterior being as strong as it cause more concerns for the person inside the car? Since there is less overall shock absorption.
"lmao just because hes buddy buddy with Elon, suddenly Cybertruck review gets a ""Iconic"" tag in the video title"
"While lots of people love to hate on the PT Cruiser it was probably the first really successful modern car to have retro styling, and sadly I'd say probably still one of the best."
Already iconic? Already rusting
Excellent review!
"More like a Volkswagon Beatle than a PT Cruiser. The Beatle was always an interesting design, even when there were millions of them - and they were very minimalistic. At the end of the day the Cybertruck is highly engineered, if imperfect, while the PT Cruiser was low tech and meh quality, while having a nice retro appeal that wore off when reality settled in. The Cybertruck provides a lot of go with its show, so it should remain ""iconic"" a lot longer. The VW Beatle is a better comparison."
I‚Äôd rather have a Pontiac Aztek.
Hurry up Tesla and make this Cybertruck in right hand drive.  I want one here in Australia!
got my cybertruck wet and it broke thanks musk
the ugliest car of all time.
I just want to say sorry to all the people I stopped in traffic to stare at this truck even after I had already watched this video. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Easily the fugliest vehicle since the Pontiac Aztec.
Can you store a bike in its tray?
After watching jerryrigs review of the Rivian I wouldn't touch this thing with a ten foot pole
"The way things are going in west coast cities, bullet proof for 9mm sounds like a great idea.
Also, not worrying about rust is killer. If you actually USE a truck, you know that real life damages paint. The stainless is a big middle finger to that problem."
"This has got to be the most embarrassing car of all time, only the Hummer might challenge it in that respect. Stepping out of this car would be like being hauled to a busy street in a bathtub, and having to step out of it naked. At least that is how Europeans feel. Perhaps this is classy to Americans?"
Iconic failure. It‚Äôs up there with the DeLorean but not as cool.
"So many of these on the roads around San Diego at this point, definitely eye-catching for its novelty. 
It strikes me as more of a marketing effort than a consumer-driven product... like a commercial on wheels."
"That is NOT a ""truck! A truck has an open bed with cargo capability. I'll call it a cybercar. Ridiculous!"
Yup it's an iconic piece of junk and after 140 years of car innovation they can't even put on a pedal correctly lol
"so what about the issues with visibility, lights, not bulletproof, bad storage?"
Tesla cope
amazing beauty
"The original concept looked good, but the real thing is comparatively underwhelming."
I live here in Mesa AZ and I‚Äôve seen a ton of guys using the cybertruck to tow their boat out to the lake. I think that‚Äôs about the only towing use case where the cybertruck excels given it‚Äôs about 40-50miles round trip. That and the flex of ‚Äúusing‚Äù the cybertruck
I'm so confused as to why safety wasn't mentioned even once?
"The pace of this video was really fun. IDK why I enjoyed it so much, but thanks for the entertainment and information."
"Owning (or wanting to own) a Cybertruck is the new Mid-Life Crisis cry for help/desperate bid to be relevant. It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.

Another fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway."
It's ugly so people look at it as if it was a train wreck.
"Many iconic vehicles are mass produced, vw beetle, mini,  40 & 70 series landcruiser, landrover defender and many more."
"""Already iconic"" No, it is not because tesla is doing child labor. They use kids and adults to mine for cobalt, gold, lithium and other materials used in electronics and they pay them with nothing. Companies like apple, google and other tech giants do the same thing which is disturbing and upsetting"
"Musk is a terrible CEO and an even worse human. As a Tesla owner myself, I hope the CT helps pull his company under."
"Regarding your second point, steel alloy, the question I ask myself, how does this fare in a crash. This car doesn't seem to have a crumple zone."
"By looking at it , you have not parked it outside very often . Save some money for plasti dip or a wrap job ."
"""this thing is insane"" (derogatory)"
"Haha please don‚Äôt mention a countach or veyron in the same sentence, bro, that‚Äôs a joke! üòÇüòÇ"
Good luck in the rain.
"13:32 A show called ""Head 2 Head"" did that race with a Model X towing an Alpha Romeo while racing an Alpha Romeo. The car being towed beat the car being driven."
Looks like garbage
Hahaha what a shill
aerodynamics of a refridgerator
2 damn trucks waiting while thousands are out there waiting for their deliveries üòä
People who don't know much about drag strips (including me) wouldn't know that it was actually a 1/8 mile race. I like Tesla because they are good products imo but they don't need to resort to false marketing.
With them saying it‚Äôs bullet proof I‚Äôd be more worried about people taking pot shots for fun. üòÇ
How did this even get approved in terms of safety for others ??
"Unfortunately you are a fan boy.
This is dangerous to everyone else‚Ä¶"
"Somewhere, Ralph Nader is pissed."
"Sorry, it‚Äôs a case of the emperor has no clothes. That‚Äôs why people stare. It‚Äôs ugly, impractical, really not a truck, people can buy trucks and just take kids to school. But if you buy a truck to even lightly use as a truck. You‚Äôve purchased the wrong vehicle. Some people ( influencers, not just Instagram ) said it was cool so people started to like it."
"Listening to this video, I‚Äôm 04:20 in, and I just saw my first Cyber truck on the road. I busted out laughing at the irony."
I am curious as well to know the price of repairing the truck. Due to the massive single panels that would mean any damage would require the whole panel of steel to be replaced. That can‚Äôt be cheap
I gotta give you props for the timing of the ads
I don‚Äôt know if I love the variable steering. I understand why it‚Äôs there but do you still have the ability to make a sharp turn? Like in the event a semi dropped something on the road and I had to swerve to avoid it could it do that or would it just lightly merge
"Hey cyber truck





Welcome 2 my World

Team America would love this truck. Truck by name. F*^ked by nature. Now hearing about the acceleration pad sliding and wedging into the footbed. Cheap cheap potential death causing nonsense.
You all bought the prop truck from the video for ‚ÄúCalifornia Love‚Äù.
"since he didnt mention it for whatever reason, the starting price for a cyber truck is only 81,000 dollars. cheaper than a LOT of ultra beefy trucks ive seen, and guys this thing is not very big. if you watched the video he compared it to a regular truck and most trucks are larger in every direction than the cyber truck. we will have to see if its worth buying once it starts being mass produced"
German Frisbeesport Club e.v ?
Back when the Model S first came to Europe everyone had to take pictures of it and it was definitely its own celebrity just like the cyber truck is today.
"I imagine it will do the same as a other teslas, People in awe of my future tech when I had my M3P in 2018  and asking for rides when going thru a drive thru, to normal everyday car like an impala these days"
Iconic =/= good
Paid for by Tesla.
"If companies don't want a bad review, just make a good product. It's not that complicated"
IncEl Camino
It is another DeLorean - Sure people will think these are cool.  But wait 5 years.   I don't think many will be wanting one. Cause it is an Electric car and people will look at the price of the battery's when they have to replace them and be like Hell No.. Sorry.
One dent on the car ur done
They're really cool looking. IDGAF
The cybertruck ad is incredibly misleading
"In the current age of mass information - nothing material can be iconic. There is nothing that is unbelievable or not seen before. The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written ""PAPA"", which is Pope in italian. But not ""the Pope"" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just ""PAPA"". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today's world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and ""in GOD we TRUST"" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a ""Verified"" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real ""devine"" person. There is this show on NG ""The best of the decades""... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn't rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten."
"Nice review, thanks!"
"Someone will make tires.  If the truck wasn't limited, it might win the race.  I would shoot the hell out of my cybertruck...SS not overrated. Cyberbeast can tow.  If you cut the back side panel and make it flat like a traditional bed, the truck would look amazing.  A flat tonneau is fine.  You can tarp anything else.   I agree the back lights could be a different scale.  Can't wait to see the mods on this thing."
The Cybertruck needs a turret like the m577 APC from aliens.
Why didn't you mention the rusting issues?
"The Cybertruck is absolutely one of the worst vehicles the world has ever seen. It is hideous. I mean a face only a mother would love. And it can't be sold in the vast majority of the planet because it does not meet safety standards. Not that Elon would care. He apparently likes the general public to crash test their poorly built vehicles, and certainly does not care about pedestrians. He is an idiot despot, and the ""truck"" is pure crap. The US media is fawning over it, of course, but that just shows their own bias."
"This thing is going to have such a high body count by the time it's finally outlawed, if the same witless zeal for consuming that made it possible in the first place ever allows the wheels of government to turn in a manner functional enough to outlaw it. Iconic, yes, iconic of just how much control we have handed over to sociopaths."
"2:31 I was ""If they get this anchor here and move it above with a nice easing transition - that would look awesome and I will hit the like button "" ... and that is what exactly happened."
that truck is so ugly tho :(
I suppose this truck will be most useful when the purge hits
"Charging $100,000 for a vehicle, spending almost 5 years on development, and making claims like Elon did (King of fake promises at this point) removes all allowance for ""early adopter issues"". When you guys had to use duct-tape to fix the door? That's when the car should have been back at the dealer and a check in your pocket to repay it.
Not to mention the tires ruining themselves with the hubcap and the things that were promised on the car and not (not even getting into the 'tent' thing).

I wanted this car, but I'll want until another dealer makes it."
"Im so tired of people crying about the CyberTruck online, ITS A COOL CAR!
And lmao yeah the statistic about people owning trucks and never using them to tow anything is so accurate, I have never met a single person irl who had a truck that actually used it for anything practical lmao"
"19:23 As a raptor owner that one particularly stung just a bit üòÇ 

I will say I won‚Äôt ever buy an EV, but damn id love to try this thing out, it‚Äôs ugly, but it‚Äôs different and that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs awesome! And yeah ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs QUICK"
"So, why call it a truck if the back side is coveredü§¶ü§î"
"HIs review of this thing is so much nicer than the Humane AI pin. He can't hide his Tesla fanboyism, as much as he tries. It's so painfully obivous, so you'd never get a fully honest review about anything Tesla related. You want that, you gotta go to Rich Rebuilds."
"I can tell you in car enthusiast areas, this thing is never the topic of conversation. Also variable steering ratios have been around for awhile. Honda uses it, BMW uses, lots of companies use it."
It looks more like a compact suv than the monster truck that I was expecting
Bro went to Island Dragwayüî•üî•üî•
"Being ""iconic"" doesn't require it to be an actually good vehicle.  All it means is that it's easily recognizable, and since I actually saw one on the road, you can recognize that POS from a mile away.  lol.  Also - being mass produced.... that's a bit of a leap.  These things are being rushed so quickly out the door that the glue hasn't even had enough time to dry yet... and as of yesterday, deliveries of the cybertruck are being halted due to faulty gas pedals...  I don't blame people for liking the concept.  it's different, weird, and shiny, and people like shiny new objects, even if they're garbage.  :/"
The Incel Camino.
This video aged poorly. Literally right before the steering and gas pedal issues came out. lol I guess I'm glad yours don't have those problems.
Save your money truck is garbage !
It‚Äôs an SUV that is trying to identify itself as a Truck.
I can't imagine paying for a car that will have some of its features delivered later via software updates (hopefully).
Tesla is pulling one of Apple moves here. They dont care if everyone has the same product. The Truck basically screams for a wrap or ‚Äúskin‚Äù. And so they will be customized.
It‚Äôs ugly broh
"i mean, it sure is iconic... not for the right reasons!"
Marques is hands down the best reviewer in the world.
"That's a great point - there're gonna be a lot of first time truck owners, and outright oopsie girls, that have unrealistic expectations about what any truck can do, and get it in embarrassing situations."
Bro you have been payed to do a promotion.
I think it looks nice tbh
Tesla build quality and materials are trash. Run away.
Cybertruck isn't bulletproof against 50 cal sniper rifle with armored piercing round went through cybertruck door and struggling through muddy waters I saw cybertruck owner got struck on rocky hill it couldn't get out
"of course the biker hates it, trucks are some of the most dangerous vehicles on the road and the cybertruck is the most dangerous out of them, especially for bikers who are on the road a lot"
adbreak RIGHT before the hammer hit is brutal
"Just say it sucks and will end up landfill, we prefer the truth and reality, The emperors new clothes was a great story."
Iconic in a rust bucket way lol
I like the Space Balls plug in there lol
They really need to start adding gears into electric cars. Will vastly improve the miles per kWh efficiency.
Cartel gonna be OP now
"They should make a Cyber SUV, with less ""truck"" stuff and a closed in trunk."
umm what kinda porsche is this? If u compare to a Porsche use a 911 GT2 RS and none of these toy versions that have no power and are just cheap versions of the real thing that is actually the fasted street legal car one can buy. so thank u for clarifying
"Everyone still stares when a DeLorean drives by. Definitely an iconic movie star of a car. . Still didn't stop it from being one of the biggest financial disasters in motoring history. I see a repeat. 
At least DeLorean was legal to drive in every country."
"There's a reason most trucks look the same - the design works. The cybertruck has horrible bed space, it's not safe in an accident, and it has issues with reliability and frame rusting."
Placed a pre-order but not taking ‚óá delivery button
I have to be honest. It's one of the ugliest vehicles I've ever seen.
A lot of people forget that there's actually 2 different towing workloads - long distance towing and short distance towing. The sort of towing that these types of vehicles are theoretically best suited to is very much short range towing and EVs are fantastic for short range towing (eg tradesmen towing equipment in a trailer to a jobsite)
Lol
Drag race earned my thumbs up üëç
Great vid
Naaaaa not buying it. Is advertised by Tesla with all the capabilities that is supposed to be better at. You‚Äôre getting paid by Tesla for this content and this video is an excuse for Tesla and a coverup about all the shortcomings of the truck. Sorry but no. Is not a review nor isn‚Äôt iconic. Is an electric truck that is not a truck at all.
Having no outside door handles? you pull on the edge of the door to open and push on the side of the door to close it? They pushed this truck out unfinished because it was taking too long. Also no tailgate step?
"Sorry, I don‚Äôt care about any of the other shit. A massive LCD screen in the center console that forces you to take your eyes off the road for every slight adjustment is a disaster and should be flat out illegal."
Will this car be in the new GTA game
"The people that don't like its looks is because it's not conventional looking.  I think getting it painted would be a good idea because bare metal will rust and  corrode, no matter if it's stainless or not."
"this shit screams ""brand deal"" the cybertruck chops off people's fingers, isnt rust proof, the glass breaks easy, and is just something a grown child on drugs named elon drew in 15 seconds on a napkin before some actual poor souls had to make it a real vehicle

let Tesla die like call of duty"
iconically dumb
i think lexus was first steer by wire by a few months
"Funny thing about Cybertruck: if say, Nigerians‚Äô first EV manufacturer designed anything like Cybertruck, it would have been universally panned and nobody would have wanted it."
is it just me? Marques looks oversized when standing next to the truck
Marcus Brownie sucks as a car reviewer.
This should be look good in matte black
tbh i think the way the gas pedal can get stuck all the way to the floor if the cover slips is the most dangerous thing
Elon musk has already created the safest cars in the world so why is everyone mad that he's trying the opposite?
In the US you have no norms for pedestrian etc? This will never be seen in the EU. It is a coffin on wheels.
"""No it's not stock"" Oh yea that's your baby for real"
"Infiniti has had steer by wire for years. Most cars have variable ratio steering, nothing new here, just Elon marketing."

"Cinematography on display here in this video is off the chain. Huge respect for the production quality. What types of lenses/cameras do you use to film? Is there a video on your channel about this already? 

Edit: Saw the link in the description of some of your equipment, but would love to hear a breakdown of your process for achieving the ""iconic"" MKBHD look and feel that is present in your videos.

Edit 2: I just found ""The Studio"" channel with all the BTS from MKBHD. Exactly what I wanted. Incredible."

Iconic - like a 911?
"Wow, a 3000 KG box of sharp, rigid metal going 911 speeds spotlight to spotlight. Yeah that sounds fun and safe üíÄ 
I've seen way smaller cars collapse brick walls on avenues given enough speed. Imagine what a three metric ton steel brick on wheels would do to plaster and drywall buildings. And I fully expect the average Tesla owner to be that careless."
"It's not Iconic, but Hyundai's EV's are (wink wink)"
I'm holding out for the extended cab version.
No mention or coverage of the bed?
"It seems like he‚Äôs trying really, really hard to rationalize liking something that he just really doesn‚Äôt like."
It's iconic for all the wrong reasons
"I think, as Elon continues to alienate more and more people with his handling of twitter, Tesla faces a branding struggle of their own. More and more people are going to have negative reactions to seeing Tesla vehicles over time, and owning one is increasingly going to be seen as supporting his personal views."

I thought the most dangerous thing was the accelerator pedal getting stuck in full blast

Big smile on my face there lol"
Comparing it to a PT Cruiser?  Why is this guy's opinion so sought after again?
The worst thing about this vehicle is that you get associated with Edgelord (synonym for Elon) and that's something that doesn't fly in my country. It's like wearing a swastika in Germany.
"Marques is a shameless Elon Musk fanboy so his objectivity is questionable. There are many other reviews that show how awful this monstrosity really is. Cheap interior (a Tesla signature), poor fitting panels and almost instant body rust to name a few."
As always üëç MKBHD
Have you ever considered why the biker gave you a thumbs down?
"left-liberals hate it with a passion, everyone else loves it."
"I remember the PT Cruiser, and that car is definitely iconic. Almost everyone wanted one. The Cybertruck though? Nope. Absurd to call something iconic that almost no one wants."
do better man sheesh.
"I feel like the PT Cruiser was getting laughed at the day it was born because it looked like what Grandpa thought was cool when he was a kid. This will never be lame like that because it looks futuristic, and it's not hard to imagine Zoomers in them."

Yeah no
No hail damage. Lower insurance costs?
"Update: Tesla has halted all Cybertruck deliveries around the same time a buyer crashed his truck after the inputs on the breaks stopped working and the car accelerated into a traffic poll, the airbags did not deploy but thankfully the driver didn't die."
Ugly! Saw one a week ago...
Note to America: he used the Chinese cellphone market landscape to identify a more competitive capitalistic ideal.
"Saw one right here in McDonough, GA last week on Avalon Pkwy, blew my mind actually!"
Just saw one on the road and had to look it up because I didn‚Äôt know what the hell it was was looking at
"Ive only seen one on the road, it was cool, I like it. And for 4 wheeling, not having the diff's and axles, the whole drivetrain, in the way is a game changer. Maybe they are keeping the moon in mind with the design? Easier to operate if you're in a space suit, and large flat surfaces for solar recharge on the moon. These could be customized to be heavy equipment tools like dozers, excavators, cranes etc on the moon. He said we are going to have a permanent base on the moon, we are going to need some heavy equipment to build it, I bet we see this thing on the moon."
Finally!! I have waited for YEARS for someone to make a new kind of pedestrian killing machine!!
it's ugly
I saw Danny Duncan driving his in Florida
"i thought the initial renders of it looked cool, but seeing videos of it in person changed my mind."
The ugliest truck in the world!
Surely the existence and excitement over an ugly bullet proof 'truck' says more about the failings of the society the 'truck' exists in?
do you take money to promote tesla products? your reviews have a clear bias
More like emblematic of idiocy and hatred for value.
The shape and design looks a bit stupid and desperate

This guy doesn‚Äôt know shit
"Usually i am not leaving negative comment on your vid, but this ""review"" is kinda you shilling or fan boying over Tesla/Elon. 
You view this from the perspective of a tech nerd, not from a perspective of a driver. 

Many review i watched say cyber truck is shit as car. It is good as conversation starter, but that's it.
It rust. Not as strong as it claims to be. Have awful truck bed capacity. Not safe at all (really a speedometer in the middle? Making you turn head when driving?). ""You are safe when you crash"" but you kill the other people in that Prius. It reflect sunlight so you can blind other driver. 

This video does not paint you in goodlight man"
Worst look
"No engine sound, you‚Äôre a nerd üòÇ"
It looks terrible and you can't use it like a regular truck
Yeah it's an iconic turd.

It's important to note that the base 911 Carrera t is the Porche variant that is closest in price to the top end CyberTruck.
I love your channel!  Thanks so much for sharing your experiences.  We'll be getting ours sometime next year. üòä
I need one. My order has been in queue. Patiently waiting.
Too edgy for me üòÖ
"You seem unfamiliar with who specifically identified with and adopted the PT Cruiser as their icon. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Cybertruck is big, dumb, and ugly, but there's some great engineering there that I look forward to seeing wrapped up in a more practical package."

The sharp corners/edges are still pretty darn dangerous and will remain once it becomes mundane
Anyone who buys this needs therapy
"Folks just can't realistically look past the fact that buying a Tesla equates to supporting an organization led by a homophobic, anti-semitic, modern day robber baron."
"It's the ugliest vehicle I have ever seen. I thought it couldn't be any uglier in person than in pictures. I was wrong. It is even uglier in person.

Just saw the best name EVER for a cybertruck.... Behold the Wankpanzer.
"""The most iconic profile is the side"" nice one"
Mkbhd has 0 credibility as a vehicle reviewer as he tends to treat most if not all electric vehicles as a piece of tech and not an actual vehicle. The cybertruck is a failure of a truck and a piece of tech. Stick to actual tech reviews.
TOO MUCH OVERACTING
no. its a pile of garbage. won't even give this video a complete view.
"Electric Car Company Loses over $500m after Customers Reviews.

A YouTuber, Marques Brownlee using the MKBHD handled reviewed an electric car called Fisker and on his YouTube channel, shared his damning observations of the car. 

He did this despite the car company asking him to wait for the software update that they said was coming to the vehicle.
 
According to MKBHD, he is reviewing it because the company had made the product public and was actually selling to customers.

Following his review where he called it the worst car he has ever reviewed, which had over 4 million views and other inefficiencies of the car company, Fisker has now recorded a net loss of over $500m. There are mutterings that the company may go bankrupt.

It happened that his review was reechoed by the users of the car with less platform.

And where is MKBHD today, surprisingly, he is still a free man with the right to call any product crap with his reasons in so far as he bought it and is sharing his honest perspective as a user.

Nigerians are struggling to relate to this because if MKBHD was in Nigeria, he will be arrested first and fellow citizens will defend it because MKBHD does not know what it takes to build a business.

*********************
Note: The car company lied about some features that are not there. An integrity issue. They also sold a product that was not ready not minding the risks this poses for their customers. Nigerians want to wait until people died before they do Quality Assurance.

Got this from Ayo Ademokoya's wall."

Does anyone want to buy a elephant tusk necklace heirloom
"""You'll be fine""

No, you won't. And that's a ridiculous statement. I can't really talk about safety, cause I don't know anything about it, so I'll just stick to common sense: cars are heavy as fuck. The difference between this and a regular car panel will be negligible when you're talking in terms on tonnes. The inside bits, the actual structure of the car, matters more. And I'll leave that to NCAP tests etc. Stainless steel changes nothing.

And when it comes to fender bender... well, again; the difference will be negligible when you're talking in terms on tonnes. Any collision that would result in a dent on a normal car will dent this. The only pro is that it isn't painted, but that's not actually a pro, cause it will rust... It won't even be worth its weight in scrap 10 years from now. And who know how much they're gonna sell spare panels for.

And this may be an unpopular opinion (j/k), but something COSTING $60.000 SHOULD NOT HAVE AN OPEN BETA! It's not a video game, it's the real world. Ridiculous.

This thing is an iPhone with none of the quality."

"its iconic. just like with computers a macbook is iconic. it's mass produced and everyone has seen one, yet with all the cheap PCs out there, it will still always be iconic. it brings a certain pride in ownership that most computers don't and the first time your friend gets one, you say ok, very nice. But after a while you get used to it, and yet it somehow stays iconic, and every time you see a dell you think why would anyone ever..."
"This guy has drank the kool-aid. The cybertrucks designs is not ""iconic"", it is novel. 
Ask a kid to draw a microphone and they'll draw a Shure sm58 without knowing what an sm58 is, that is iconic. Its the image that represents the general concept of a microphone for generations. Ask a kid to draw a pick-up truck, they'll draw a Ford f150, it is the image and shape conjured when picturing a truck. That is iconic."
Legit a trainwreck of a vehicle
"The cybertruck has deeply concerning flaws, I was hoping for an objective review and this was not that. I‚Äôm disappointed."
"Stop doing business with Tesla until Musks apologizes, or be a hyprocrite and a tool."
I just believe everyone watches your channel so I would be shock that they didn't know about this truck üòÇ
It‚Äôs a mistake to conflate some missing options like tires and software features when only the first few thousand are being made with somehow this being a choice that Tesla is going to impose on all 2mm preorders as if it will stay this way. These options will come for sure.
keen to see what the narrative will be in 5 years. awesome content
"Just unsubbed from this tool. ""Dbrand, mad a bad joke...."" meanwhile ""tesla gobble gobble"""
Expensive but usless possession.
"It is, without doubt, an eye-catcher. Taste is very subjective, so whether I feel it looks ugly is irrelevant. The thing that gets me is that stainless steel body which isn't stainless. Bird shit, road salt etc. all have to be removed immediately, otherwise you'll have permanent stains on the metal surface. The interior is simply boring. Minimalism in it's most extreme sense. My opinion on Musk as a conspiracy theorist is also irrelevant."
"That‚Äôs funny, Marcus it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre describing Matt Ralph‚Äôs chin.
Oh my god that takes me back when I was 18 years old and purchased a brand new 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser in Inferno red metallic with a five speed manual and all disc brakes.  Everything you‚Äôre describing about the cyber truck was reaction. I was receiving with this Chrysler PT Cruiser other people loved it or hated it. That same summer I drove my grandmother and grandfather back to Chihuahua M√©xico in order to pick up my grandmother‚Äòs diabetes prescription. I wish I had a dash cam too show the amount of attention we received in Chihuahua Mexico. Obviously the PT cruiser ended up as a design exercise for Chrysler at the time and now no one cares about this little vehicle. But at the time we felt like celebrities driving this unique vehicle in the early 2000s."

I guess ethics are totally dependent on whether you get a free car at the end of it, huh?"
Modern cars are generally designed to have crumple zones in case of a high impact accident. Something tells me the cyber the truck was neither engineered with that particular safety feature in mind..
It's tough to watch complementary reviews on Tesla and Rivian that obviously have flaws after he trashed Fisker.
"It's not a truck, but I think a better example of an iconic mass produced vehicle is an Airstream. Originally built in the 1930‚Äôs, the design has changed very little, they still turn heads, people stop and comment, and I've never heard of anyone disliking them so much, they give them a thumbs down."
The fastest Mars rover.
"The vehicle is completely ""un""engineered from being convenient, to trendy. A horrible vehicle design."
REALLY NICE CAR
I wonder if marques will ever review neurlink
@mkbhd where is your mic? It sounds like you are speaking right into a studio mic but I don‚Äôt see any mic on your body
Someone parked their cyber truck next to a restaurant I was at last weekend and it took like 10 min for someone passing by to write ‚ÄúI ‚ù§ BIG DICKS‚Äù in the dust on the back of it

It‚Äôs iconic ? Was the Pontiac Aztek also iconic?
"As I immerse myself in storytelling and video creativity, VideoGPT quietly works its magic, transforming my content into captivating pieces of art."

"I drive a Model 3 Performance myself, but I'm really glad that cybertrucks are banned in the EU. For all other road users, an accident involving a cybertruck can quickly become fatal. There's a reason why they don't build cars with stainless steel."
It's an ugly design
I'm positive sure these will be collectable for a number of reasons and soon it's a possibility it will stop production in suggest all cyber truck owners hold on to them they will be the next hunmer h1 one sort mistake on design is the missing door handles would have been better if they were hidden or as option just leave it out
"It's hard to say what's the worst thing about them, but EVs are dumber than dirt, and truck EV is even more absurd."
LOL what bunch of BS
What's the crumble zone like in this truck?
"Iconic != unique look. 

Reminds me more of the Chrysler Prowler or the Saturn Sky when I first saw them. Just an interesting looking vehicle that everyone who saw it assumed it was expensive, but I hadn‚Äôt thought about in 20 years."
I like the look. Ppl think it's hilarious but I find most cars hilarious..your average car just look like a bun bread. The cyber truck looks clean sleek. Problem is if it's so reflective then it's so bad for road safety. Need to somehow make it more matt I guess. I feel like it'll make a nice camping car. Haha
wish i could afford
By far the ugliest car I've seen in my life

One of my main personal reasons for disliking the car is because the design looks immature and I don‚Äôt like Elon Musk.
It should be a police car üòÇ
"Cars already feel hostile. The cybertruck is American automotive hostility refined to a point, literally."
The answer is no
It is iconic like the Ford  Edsel and the Pontiac Aztec
It does look like a refrigerator
The Edsel was iconic too. And Ford Prefect was given his name from Douglas Adams on much the same reason American's laugh at the Edsel.
Iconic like Yeezy's... from stupidly overpriced aftermarket value to everyday and even below retail MSRP value.
I must be the only one who looks at it with abject disgust on my face.
Wooooooooooo weee that Porsche is good looking. Gah damn!
Great content as always M.
I've seen like 3 of these in South Beach. These things are fucking hideous.
"My ultimate issue with the Cybertruck is honestly more of an issue with Tesla and this new wave of ""techie"" vehicles overall: longevity. All the software and touchscreens replacing perfectly functional features (such as doorhandles!) seems to me a hundred more ways a car can break. If I buy a car I hope it will last me at least the better part of a decade. With Teslas, I can't see it lasting more than a few years before they shut down the software, or worse, something breaks and is no longer supported, and then I have to buy a new car again. It's all just a vanity purchase rather than a practical vehicle."
"I love this thing because it‚Äôs different. To that point, F150s, RAMs, Silverados and Sierras are god awfully ugly and dated. Some of the trims on those trucks are cool but you‚Äôre going to spend high five figures to upwards of 6 figures for those trims."

I don‚Äôt blame the people for recording the cybertruck. If I saw a refrigerator that had wheels I would to.
"Instead of being honest about Cybertruck, Marques is worried about what Lunatic Musk will say about him or it will jeopardize his future with Tesla reviews. Selling your soul to the devil for money. Cybertruck is overhyped, overpriced , under delivered and rushed out the door rust bucket. Don‚Äôt forget to kiss Lunatic Musk ass on the way out."
"The VW Beetle, Nissan Skyline,  Mercedes SL are some examples of iconic mass produced cars. So it can happen. 

But the cybertruck will need many more years till there is consensus it's an icon. But for now it looks an iconic design so far. Great vid!"
"I think a vehicle to compare it to when you say ""Iconic"" would be the Hummer. I remember when it first came out it was a big deal, than kinda calmed down over the years. I think the Cybertruck is gonna be very similar."

"Fact of the matter is, this is a truck that sucks at towing long range, going off road- basically all the things a truck should do. Oh, and you'll have to wait a long time to get one after paying. Rather get a Ram TRX."
I will help you out.  The cybertruck looks horrible.  Maybe spend some time looking at classic cars from different eras to gain some insight as to how shit it really is.  For a start I suggest looking at the various streamlined cars inspired by the art deco movement.  There are steam locomotives that are 1000 times more aesthetically pleasing than the cybertruck.

I saw one yesterday. Its the lowest polly 3 ton killing machine i have ever seen
It‚Äôs just spectacle like an accident on the side of the road or a giant puppet
Love to PT Cruiser analogy
Damn this guy makes nice videos. Huge fan from South Africa üáøüá¶
"this car should be cheaper than prius.  look at these cheapeast materials. cheapest plastic on bumpers, sheets of aluminium , look at the lack of complexity of stop lights; they are just the cheapest components from chinese market. there is literally nothing is the interior. and they trying to pump hype into it and sell it for premium price. I imagine a german car designer looking at this garbage"
"The best way to clean stainless steel,.... ZERO WATER,... it's the minerals that make stainless steel look ""fingerprenty"",... use ZERO WATER,... work great on a stainless steel fridge as well."
Iconic? Sure. Dont think you'll like what it's iconic of.
"I've had an F-250, F-350 and currently looking forward to getting rid of my F-450 for the CT. EVs are not bad at towing, their basic higher efficiency just makes it look that way."
"Does steer by wire impact the need to get an alignment? Or how does, or does not this impact the cybertruck getting out of alignment"
Iconic for 5 minutes. Then erosion sets in.
"Iconic looking??? 
Ironic looking more like it."
"ICONIC. No, I don't think it's going to take the same path as the PT Cruiser. The difference is that the PT Cruiser was actually a piece of junk, sharing the same platform as the Neon. The Cybertruck is not."
I am disappointed with this biased video
You're saying dumptruck like it's a bad thing.
I‚Äôve seen 3 of these in the last week did they just sell a bunch of these cause I feel like that‚Äôs not normal üòÇ
"I love how all the Cybertruck reviews dance around the fact that it sucks at being a ""truck"" doing actual truck things."
"pt cruiser is the ugliest ""car"" on the planet(along with pontiac aztec)...The comparison here with Tesla as iconic and pt cruiser is a little stupid..."
"Sounds like the same pain owners of super cars have, where people drive recklessly on highways just to ""video"" your car"
"Love the ""Deutscher Frisbeesport-Verband e.V."" Jersey"
"I love this video, really high quality, good points and feels complete in a way; Only downside is that yes they choose to race it against the ""weakest"" porsche, but also it's the most similar for pricetag to go against, so it doesn't feel that unfair. Of course the fact they beat it only for half race it's a bit of a cheating but yes, it's to make a point, not to assume you should go to track with it"
"That thing looks like an Aliexpress novelty PC case made from recycled scrap metal. Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck."
"i feel like tesla's ""minimalism"" is not just a design decision but a way to maximise their revenue."
"My God when he pulled out the Porsche, which I was thinking he was going to do, I said to myself: 
""This guy is the best youtuber in history"""
Can it handle the speed while taking hard turns? Like how well can it do on a track with turns?
"17:12 now go to a track, not a drag line - that‚Äôs where Porsche will beat it twice the timeüòÇ"
"Oh this car will be iconic alright, by being the carmageddon embodiment of american psychosis"
This is one of the best videos you have ever done dude. Wonderfully executed
Low budget for a high price.  Prone to rust.
"That's not a truck. That's a bastardization of a useful vehicle. As with all Teslas, the powertrain and battery are top of the line. But the cabin and exterior are Fisher-Price potato chip quality garbage. It's a modern day DeLorean. And it's Tesla's first version of a vehicle that will eventually go out of style. ""Cyber"" is already out of style. Tesla is doing the same thing GM does with it's own brands that have died Pontiac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Saturn, Hummer, Geo, etc. Tesla will have to discontinue the CT when people stop buying it. It took Tesla WAY TOO long to come to market after it's announcement."
Great evaluation!!
"17:08 ‚Äúmy child‚Äù got me‚Ä¶must be nice my guy, hopefully I‚Äôll have a child like that one day! üòÇ"
This video is proof having a channel makes you just as smart as someone who would spend $100k on a rusting garbage truck.
Ugliest most over priced useless vehicle ever.
"I think we need more tech like the cybertruck, or even ideas like it. Dare to do things radically different come what may."
Watching this so I can compare it to whistling diesel‚Äôs review
"I just really hope that if this thing comes the the EU, it wont start a truck culture here, we dont loke trucks at the moment and thats a good thing, makes our roads safer, but frankly, I dont want the cybertruck to even come here at all"
"am i the only one who notice that someone writes ""CT1"" on the window????"
I wonder how many times he was pulled over lol
"It was a similar feeling when the 3/Y were released.
You saw one and you were thought ""OMG it's the new Tesla""
Now you might see it and think ""it's a Tesla"" but it's less of a wow"" and more of a ""that's cool"""
"Great review super well put together, your team and you constantly keep striving for bette, here for it!"
no
I think it really looks cool
"Iconic is such an overused term these days, half of Huckberry‚Äôs inventory is ‚Äúiconic‚Äù."
Ummmmm the PT Cruiser didn‚Äôt have over 500 HP and go 0-60 in 3 seconds.
Are you F‚Äôing kidding me?! Tesla creates a truck that accelerates faster than most half a million dollar super cars built for racing and you‚Äôre calling the performance of this thing overrated? I‚Äôd hate to be in a relationship with you. Impossible to impress apparently.
Why I feel I have watched this video like long time ago already
"How do you not comment on interior quality, ride quality, viewing angles etc when reviewing this car though?"
taking the CT into JC is crazy lmaoo
WADE MODE IS crazy!!!!
Dont they run their wiring in a series?
fun fact the infinite q50 and q 60 have steer by wire
"16:20 Is the Cybertruck limited at top speed by software? What does the Cybertruck torque curve look like compared to the 911? 17:05 ""...electronically limited top speed..."". Where did it hit that limit. One reason electric motors don't need gears is because of their torque curve. ICE needs gears to ""get out of the hole"" (i.e. to get started). They have little low-end torque."
"12:00 The percentage of commercial and industrial trucks used for hauling has to be near 100%. Try  to find one without a hitch. That goes for the yard guys all over the place pulling their mower trailer, and the ones that need it just occasionally to pull a load of lumber, drywall, rental equipment, etc. Also, these would likely not be bothered too much by range. They're seldom going more than 100 miles per day. Hauling is a non-issue... unless you're in the FUD business."
"10:40 Headlights are problematic in snow. The snow packs over them and they're not heated. Ask anyone who has driven one in a blizzard. You ""have"" to get out and clean them off periodically."
"6:30 Stainless steel is not only overrated, it's undesirable (because of weight). I would have favored aluminum sheet (even if a little thicker) than stainless sheet. I expect in the future the stainless will be abandoned... and the styling changes aluminum will offer will be leveraged."
"5:40 At high speeds the steering actually ""crabs"" when changing lanes. The back wheels and front wheels turn the same amount in the same direction."
The most dangeroues thing is that you were paid to make this video u shill üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
EV tires are special built and they're twice as expensive as regular tires but last half as long. I hope EV buyer keep that in mind.
cherry picking at play
Cyberjunk.
"People love toys, and this is a toy. Let's see how long it takes for the kids to get bored with this one. (from a Tesla owner)"
Robo- Cop's car.
Ok now i think the social problem you mentioned it happening because a celeb youtuber is inside the car lol
totally would rock it only cuz it looks cool!
"Currently 18 with a 6 figure net worth, hopefully within a few years I can afford a cybertruck"
"Is it a paid promo?
The amount of effort Marques put on this video is out of the world.
He tried hard not to contradict much with original thoughts on the previous video and still sound to be an ad for the Truck.
He didnt mention a single negative without trying to sound it as a positive. (Including the price,boollet proof, performance etc.)
He didn't even review the truck apart from hand picking few positives and white washing the negatives he said last time.
This video is not in his AF channel but his main channel for much much bigger audience."
13:20 how is that fine? are americans this obsessed with driving killing machines?
Driving a Porsche on a drag strip is such an american thing to do !  Porsche belongs to a proper race track with turns - and Nordschleife is it's home ground. What a waste of a perfectly good Porsche ;-)
Actually REE has been producing the steer by wire truck chasis for a while. But is going for a different market.
"I think it is stupid, because the stainless steel is going to mark and rust, the tray is too small to be useful. All the other features are cool."
"Thanks for the great insights @mkbhd it was well informative and you are truly the best Point, Blank, Period! ‚ù§"
The most genius aspect of the cybertruck bodywork is that Tesla has convinced the world that no design is the best and coolest design. Way easier for production and cost purposes. Tesla is saving a ton of money on stamping out these boring shapeless body panels.
"Sorry buddy, can't hear ya behind all those chromatic aberrations."
Iconic fail
@20:30 drag coefficient is actually a solid 0.34 compared to mid .4s for the average pickup.
9:50 So you're a beta... Tester üòÇ
Well madeüéâ
Simp...
"I'm disappointed. I've lost so must trust in mkbhd and this video is the perfect example of why. It feels so disconnected, and soft on serious life-threatening issues that plague this car. What other issues have you glossed over, minimized, or covered up in your other videos about phones I might have actually wanted to buy?"
"OK, that opening, graphic, sequences, boss!"
plz do a poco x6 pro reveiw
"I saw a red cybertruck on the highway, and yeah, it was a site to see."
One can usually tell when someone is sitting between two cars no matter the size of the portion visible. At 23:40 (ICONIC) its like you are sitting between two pieces of furniture ü§£
This is a joke! It's not a truck.
thank you for the shoutout to engineering explained
Can you make a video on the Zune 30GB?
"If you liked the rear view of the Pontiac Aztek, you'll love the rear view of the Cybertruck."
"When he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go getting any ideas it‚Äôs invincible‚Ä¶‚Äù I halfway expected the title card to pop up.
Iykyk"
Yeah I was wondering about the DAC and AMP quality that is built in to this truck and what's the speakers type and quality and resistance in ohms? And is it a surround system or just stereo?
This thing is not bulletproof.
tesls after 5 years of mewing
"Love your videos, ‚Äúkeeping it real‚Äù!"
Welcome to things i cant afford but still watch
@6:39 üò≥ I was ready for him to pull a 9mm outüéØ
VW Beetle is also another iconic mass-produced vehicle I would say.
You're brilliant man!
Hey I've always wondered if Best Buy's open box items are worth it or reliable. What are your thoughts on them?
"While I don‚Äôt like the cybertruck, however I think you did a fair job with this video. üëç"
"Fun fact, the supposed 6 wheeled version was partly intended to be an APC that could  be offered to militaries."
Top half looks a bit a Lamorgina Countach
"Franz Von Holzhausen once again proving he's a terrible designer. None of his vehicles look exceptional for the price, the roadster is very difficult to screw up but very generic.  He's basically a Mazda guy who lucked out and got in early with Tesla."
Did the fender dent when you hit it with the sledgehammer?
"I'm not a Tesla fan at all, mainly because i don't really like the design of any of their cars (don't particularly like Musk, either). However, i do think the designer(s) of this hulking piece of metal have been very lazy. It's like they've just binge-watched hours of Robocop-type shows and come up with this. The 6000 SUX is something i vaguely remember."
That truck is utter trash the design is so horrible on original just something out a 1984 sci-fi movie. It‚Äôs brand new and already looks outdated üòÇ
"VW Beatle is iconic, and that one is/was very common."
"i can listen you all day Marquees

great video as always"
Marques should matte black wrap his cybertruck
"I don't know about you guys in the US but here in Europe this thing won't even be sold (which I don't really care about - most cities are too narrow for trucks anyways) because of safety regulations, especially for pedestrians. Is that a concern for you?"
"i think the reason people think it's more expensive is because it looks like a dumb modern art project, and dumb modern art projects are overly expensive"
"So what I‚Äôm hearing is, the Cybertruck is the ultimate pavement princess."
its a combination of iron man and halo 3 warthog
"Lol, 80-20 happy to angry ratio, my ass. This car is a midlife crisis mobile for people who are desperate for attention. 

A lot of people are making pictures of it, just like they would gather at an accident to gawk at the carnage."
"Whoever did that intro graphic, you KILLED it"
yo
May be I take Rivan!
"This video is ICONIC. Fire man, as always."
I'm waiting to see what you want to say about iphone se4 and pixel 8a ü§î
"Well, Air Jordans are still inconic and everyone wears them. I don‚Äôt think the rarity will matter. This is a revolutionary design."
"This is an unexpectedly positive review with very few mentions of any criticisms other reviews have been levying at the car. Where‚Äôs the discussion on the safety of this car, both for the driver and for others on the road? Or the build of materials degrading after only 500 miles for many drivers? Or why are so many passes given for unfinished features for this practically six figure vehicle? It‚Äôs a very well produced video but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like a review at all."
People who don't like your truck are less likely to go up to you and tell you. Kyle from Out of Spec channel tried to make the same point as you but off screen his girlfriend broke in and told him about how much more often she heard people complaining about the truck because they didn't know she was with Kyle.
15:44 you played for Germany?:) greetings from Stuttgart ‚úåüèª
"Iconic??? The Lo-Res car, and the process that led to it, was/is iconic! The Lo-Res pickup truck is just an embarrassing imitation!!"
Thank for your video.
"Hay Marques, can you make an in-depth review of the new Xiaomi 14. Think it's a killer phone for the price !"
A 3000kg Beta test? Sounds safe
"Am I wrong in thinking the only reason the steel is ""safe"" is because it weighs 3 tons? If it gets hit by another 3 ton vehicle, whoever is inside is going to get rocked. Why have we allowed this trend in vehicles?"
Marques... Bro... This is the third video on this and you try so hard to mitigate how much of a shit show this car is... You sure you're not being paid
already ironic
Just as well it's not coming to the UK - people wouldn't be able to stop laughing - not good when we're supposed to be concentrating on all those pot holes that we're trying to avoid.
"Lmao, this review is a joke. Then again, what to expect from this guy?"
Jeep Wrangler...  Iconic.  911  Iconic.   VW Beetle..   Iconic. Miata   Iconic. -
"Saw a video shoot .45 rounds into it 
Looks pretty tough"
Really thought for a second that he is going to pull out a Gun 6:45
"Yeah, but Countach is beautiful; Cybertruck and  Veryron are weird looking."
we for real dumb
First 30 seconds of talking was crap. The car is a junkheap pushed by a man with the mentality of a 10 year old and a very bad drug habit. This thing rusts like mad and is very poorly designed. It is NOT iconic.
"It‚Äôs big, ugly and apparently really unsafe, not sure why anyone would want to buy one of these."
Bulletproof stainless steel and reinforced glass when you see the roadragers starting shooting at you üòÖ...definitely underrated!
It looks like something a child doodles bruh
people who don't like this truck don't want to come up and talk to you.
The word iconic has become meaningless.
"Sorry but this truck is seriously ugly, not to mention dangerous.."
It's the face mask of the iron man. It is a crap car.
"Tesla understands social media marketing. They could have made a completely fair, honest, reasonable video about how quick the cybertruck is, and it would have gotten no attention. Instead, they made a video that was intentionally misleading but still impressive, and now it's being replayed to massive audiences in reviews all over social media, for free."
Has anyone been carjacked in one of these yet?
No infinite q50 was first to do it with wire steering
This is not a review. This is an ad. How is visibility? Range? How long is the tray? You didnt mention a single negative without trying to spin it as a positive?
"12:04 short list of trucks for towing, none of them are electric"" according to Rivian and Ford both the RT1 and Lightening can tow, i didn't check the Hummer or Wrangler if you want to consider those electric trucks but would be surprised if they had 0 towing capacity."
"I think I was just tricked into watching a twenty-eight minute long Cybertruck commercial. 
I feel cybercukt."
"This is the best MKBHD video I‚Äôve ever seen. Forget the fact that it‚Äôs about the cyber truck I‚Äôm talking about the writing, cinematography, the editing, and those transitions üëåüèª

The crew at the studio absolutely killed it!

I want to see more videos like this. I loved all the walking and moving camera shots outside. 

I don‚Äôt know what you would call this type of video but I think you should do more videos in this style!"
That‚Äôs not true. 63% of truck drivers tow their inflated egos on their trucks. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I‚Äôm not hating, but you can see where this truck is sort of like the back to the future car and a few other sci-fi trucks from the 80s"
"Depending on where you live, Teslas are still pretty uncommon. I always notice them on the road because they‚Äôre not common and they‚Äôre unlikely to ever be unless you live in LA."
I feel your description of ‚Äúiconic‚Äù is the same as what we saw with the Range Rover Evoque. Looked insane and then more and more common until it was a normal car
"If someone hits you, you‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôm not so sure of that. I worry about lack of crumple zones"
Best video of the year
"Looks like what people in the 50's thought we would be driving.

Thankfully they were mostly wrong.

There are ao many cars out there that look ultra modern without looking like a childish fever scream.

Saying that, if its for you, why the hell not!"
The PT cruiser was absolutely beautiful. I wanted my mom to buy one so bad just so she could have one and that I can be driven around in one. It was just so much different then anything else. If the cyber truck turns into another version of that car then Elon did it again.
"Cybertrucks pathway is not to icon, it's to disruption."
An Iconic PoS...
If they could make this car not so unnecessarily dangerous it be a lot more interesting.
people are going to talk to you because you're marques brownlee. you're a rock star.
"The Cybertruck design is FUTURISTIC ü•∞
If you are a fan of ""old"" models, the beautiful cybertruck design will most likely cause you rejection. However, people who love new experiences and enjoy modern designs find it beautiful, that is very apart from the fact that it is made bulletproof, that is, it will resist the attacks of criminals who currently work in packs and well armed."
"money talks, dude..."
"Man, these shots (of the truck, while driving) look like the highest end rendering I've ever seen. It's literally crazy ... better than any high end production movie.."
Bullet proof under-rated some of the rock's i get that almost go threw this cheap tin on these truck's.
Can we give the animators a round applause!? stellar work here!
marques not knowing people are laughing at this fucking truck
"repairability 0%, also the sharp edges omg, pop up headlights were banned because of the sharp edges and here tyou have a fcking truck that is literally like a giant geometry square"
it kinda reminds me of geometry dash
Hey i need surgery if you willing to help reply or at least thoughfully pray for me ‚ù§
"Love your reviews.  I've never owned a tesla, have always had trucks and Jeeps.  This is iconic. It feels like a swiss army knife."
"Those people pointing , they were just pointing out all the fingerprints"
"Mrwhosetheboss or Marques Brown, who will test Xiaomi SU 7 first?"
A very ugly product!!!
You can't trust a car review from a biased owner
I have nevera seen a Porsche doing 10.2 wow
"Hey Marques, this same panel gap issue was on my Ford Mustang Mach-E passenger side. Same cause as well, loose door latch on the frame, not torqued completely. Sounds like its not Tesla specific but something that can just happen in the manufacturing of cars during that step."
It's an Iconic joke.... üòÅ
It looks like crap. There is nothing iconic about it.
i believe lexus put steer by wire on one of their vehicles in 2022
"They forgot that a truck is meant to carry stuff. Not a working tool, just another fad from the raging X man"
I dunno man theres no way you can put this overpriced unused n64 asset in the same breath as actual iconic vehicles. Way too much slobbering on elon's stick shift here & on the channel overall. Unsubbed ü´∞
"Saving the planet, one 3 ton car at a time."
"In socal seeing a few a day. It wont ever get the pt cruiser effect. People didnt freak the hell out over the pt they thought it looked a little different. People are crashing to get videos of CT still. Even after initial hype wears off it will be iconic the way porche body shape is, or mini cooper, or vs bus / beetle, it will become one of the new shapes every one knows, and 80% love 20% hate maybe the ratio shifts in time either way, it wont ever be deemed in the same status as a pt any where outside this video and that comment üòÇ"
"I'll have to say Marques, You did the most classy automobile review ever.The visuals are peak.Hats Off !!"
how much was to shill for this??
Lol didn't the cyberpunk go bankrupt üòÖ
oh its going to be iconic....for allllll the wrong reasons. lol
"For me there's only one thing that's great about Tesla, their nationwide super charger system. The screen shit inside is too minimal, the interior  is ugly, the build quality is not enough, but most importantly the CEO is a terrible human. Every single positive part of Tesla is overshadowed by him. They need to fire him. I just can't get behind the idea of getting a Tesla. Especially with him involved.

I'm in agreement with the cyclist."
"""...my child..."" had me rolling"
Your child üòÖ
More ironic than iconic
Much of the criticism of the cybertruck is more political than it is technological.
This video aged badly. So many reviews of actually real world usage of this truck and how cheaply made this thing is and how they lied about the tent that comes with it and how bad quality it is.
The sound of your Porsche on takeoff is incredible
"As the owner of 2 Model X‚Äôs who has been very happy with them- and holding a deposit for a Cybertruck- I don‚Äôt plan to buy it.  Way too many production flaws and as much as I think it‚Äôs cool- and like the stainless look- the rust and fingerprints would drive me nuts. I hope Tesla sells millions of them but for me, no thanks."
Xiaomi 14
"80:20 joy-disgust ratio? Highly doubt it. The majority of those 80% most likely think that the cybertruck driver is a clown. On top of that, there are so many people who know nothing about the car and might seem excited, i wonder what would happen if you would actually tell them what kind of piece of garbage the car is and how dangerous it is? My biggest pet peeve about this video is how you spent the majority of time discussing things that are not important and barely glanced over things that make this car a dangerous, overpriced piece of garbage"
Everyone forgets that Elon just stole Tesla from two other guys who made the company.  And then he makes a nightmare truck that will hurt everyone else in an accident.  Thanks Elon!
Only poor people in YouTube comments complain about CyberTruck
Duh of course people are going to stare at something new or different.
That German person is so lucky to have traded jerseys with Marques! üòÆ
I think the biggest problem is the CEO of Tesla üôÑ
I care about 4Runner much more Apr. 9th üòç
"Super Informative and balanced Marques, I only stumbled across your channel a few months ago it is clear why you are so popular, huge respect and thanks"
"For those who love Tesla miracles, the cryptocurrency $XWG [XWG Coin] is currently going UP and could have LIMITLESS money for all people here RIGHT NOW!"
You‚Äôre every videos background music is just amazing combination  ‚ù§
More like Cyberjunk!
Excellent videoüëç
3:47
"From a boy to a man, Marques came from long way, the quality of this video is stunning !!"
"Hey Marques, please consider doing video on xiaomi 14, presently its the best compact phone in market"
TESLA'S AMAZING!!!
Phenomenal video Marques!!!!
All your videos are negative
Day 2 of asking Marques Brownlee for a Smartphone
"Bullet proof steal and super safe, but wait, the finger prints - overrated? WTF. this pickup car is faster than many other sports cars, but it is slower on long distances, so it is overrated?! What is wrong with you?"
"Saw one today on my walk, which was cool, but didn't pay it more than a passing glance... prefer that one truck pulling a passenger aircraft... the good and classic Chevy trucks, built to outperform and outlast. I intend to buy a truck and install a 4L80E transmission for the same reason as its the improved transmission for the Chevy Squarebody, the one pulling the 747 Plane, and yes, that was legit."
I have seen the Xiaomi one and this ugly thing on the same dayüôÇ
‚ù§
"Hey just wanted to say that this is, objectively and subjectively, a top tier video. Really enjoyed how thorough you were on this one"
"When you cut out all curves, what shape do you have left:@&*%"
It was hard to press the dislike button. But not talking about the safety of these disgusting kill machines is absolute ignorance. No number of B rolls will compensate the lack of talk about safety in this video. This is a detriment to pedestrains and is sure to trailblaze an upsetting trend of huge fast kill machines
8:38 My Model Y had the exact same issue. Tesla mechanic came and fixed it.
Well.... The Cybertruck is also not crash tested. SOMEHOW they managed to arrange it so that Tesla gets to decide for themselves whether its safe or not. Obviously because it will not pass a regular crash test.
Being an Elon‚Äôs bootlicker is not iconic.
Millions of Cybertrucks? lmfao....yeah....that's never going to happen.
"This car is a laughingstock, not iconic, but ok."
Loved the new Cybertruck review by Miles Morales.
"Dude I like you and I like your work. But that truck. Eh. I encountered one in real life recently in a parking lot. I really didn't like what I was seeing. The angles on this thing are dangerous to peds, cyclists, and smaller vehicles. I cannot get past the potential dangerousness of it to enjoy it otherwise. It's not only this truck. But the trend amongst makers of mid/large SUV'S and trucks to have these blunted (vs sloping front ends) making them appear more like large tractor trailer trucks is ridiculous. I have a Jeep and a Miata (that was rear ended today by a Chevy truck with this design) and in the two seater, drivers of these vehicles bear down very aggressively with their lights blinding me. My partner and I have had several rear and side enders with these trucks. She was driving today when it happened. I spoke with a coworker who had a similar vehicle and rides motorcycles and he emphatically voiced the same concerns. We both love two and four wheeled vehicles but the C.T. is is flat out dangerous to others. This thing is worse because it literally has no front bumper. I don't see how it even passed safety standards. Or where they made to go away to please E.M."
Rear view mirror should be digital. Love that about my Chevy Bolt
I saw one at the homedepot yesterday. It looked like a stainless stick oven üòÇ They could've coated with gold to make it look cooler
"Iconic is the VW bug, the Ford Mustang, Ford F150, the Chevy Corvette, the US Army Jeep, etc.  Cyber Truck...not so much."
It is so flat perfect for gluing solar panels on the surface
"0:22 Thank God I‚Äôm different and truly wouldn‚Äôt give a üí© if I saw one of these ugly things on the roadü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I mean it‚Äôs a freaking vehicle, step out the Matrix for a sec."
I dont like being beta. I like being alpha.
dude stop selling out for wallets im sick of seeing your shit commercial
So obvious he‚Äôs got stock in the is. Shameless
title is alread iconic and they are breaking at 5 miles lol
Ive always liked the design but there are really good choices electric truck out there. So to each their own.
Silverado EV seems like it can tow pretty far
"My child, oh I mean the carüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Total Junk
Lol...having that gap would be no surprise if he only knew how production worked at Tesla. having worked for Tesla i've seen far worse than that and i worked in the energy sector but my position game me access to things most employees didn't have. just another Elon marketing tool to keep interest up in the company.
The Suspension: üòä
The 2014 and 2015 Stingrays did the same thing before production picked up.
"Marques, just highlighting something because it‚Äôs the second time I‚Äôve heard you make the same mistake. You say ‚Äúyaw‚Äù when what you mean is ‚Äúpitch‚Äù. Yaw is rotation around the vertical axis and pitch is rotation around the lateral axis. Just a bit of constructive feedback."
"I remember the New Beetle from the early 2000's had a similar effect as the PT Cruiser around the same time. We were all familiar with the old VW Beetle, its an automotive icon. Then this new car comes out, especially as cars in the 90s had gone through the 'melted cheese' design era of soft curves, and sloping shoulder lines. The New Beetle was round, but it was geometric. It was upright and tall for a small car, headroom like this was unheard of in a compact. Once they hit mass production, they were just another car on the road, but seeing them at first release was a cool sight, kind of like the Cybertruck now."
"This is what happens when you give an overhyped electric car to a techtuber who knows nothing about actual cars.  Please stick to phones and laptops, this aint your forte."
"Great video, thank you sir."
"It's ""Iconic"" because it looks like no other car ever mass produced. Which means its eye catching. Good or Bad. And the amount of videos showing its arguably terrible build quality speaks for itself on if its a good vehicle and worth its price, which it really isn't unless you don't care about that."
PT Cruiser comparison now I for sure never want one üòÇ
"Hey man, I have to say that I love your videos and not just for the content which is awesome but for the research and thought that you put into each one of them! I am extremely impressed by your ability to communicate and the way that you present your content! Keep it up :)"
The front of the car isn't good at all. There's a reason cars aren't shaped like battering rams unless they're made to be battering rams.
"Weather or not a truck is any good depends on how you intend to use it. To me, it's just another tool. I want the most practical truck for my construction business. I don't give a damn about how it looks. Definitely not a fan of Tesla's sloped bed sides - would make putting anything over the side or getting something out of the front of the bed an extreme annoyance and would really piss me off.  If I can't put a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood on the floor of the bed and close the tailgate - useless for my purposes. I punctured a gas tank on a F150 on a rough site - the replacement was about $1,935. To replace the Tesla battery back itself with all modules in it would be around $16,000.  A windshield for a Ford F150 will cost about $700. while the Cybertruck retails for $1,900.  I know it's because of the electronics in the Tesla glass but how do those electronics help my carpenters put more money in my pocket? Now we also have to factor in insurance costs. Insurance companies are steadily raising their rate for EV's because of the ridiculous repair costs. Let's face it, the Tesla truck doesn't seem like it's going to be a long term player in the construction business. More like a novelty item for those that would use it for anything other than your run of the mill pickup."
"I hate to unsubscribe because I like his reviews on most things but I'm so sick of him being such a shill and fanboy for Tesla and Elon Musk.   

He points out some very serious issues in the first video and then still says he would rather be in the cyber truck then the other ones that aren't pieces of crap like the cyber truck."
Beetle and the golf
"Teslas are regular traffic, the people who buy them don't actually have money but think Teslas make them appear wealthy. It's a status symbol for pretentious humans."
The intro thoughüî•
I am impressed with the reviewer more than the truck!
15 defects when you've only delivered like 1000 cars is a really high defect rate. Toyota would be firing guys lol
Felt closer to a marketing video instead of a review
Why so many app updates?
Why is he being so diplomatic?
Dope Shirt üî•Greetings from Germany!!
"I compare it with the delorean, also very ugly car but still very unique and iconic."
"Trucks a failure, yet these famous Youtubers still push it."
"I think in when you talk about vehicles being Icon and people stopping to stare at them, a few come to mind. When the Beetle was re-leased as the new Beetle, at first we got so many people stopping to stare at us and wave to us, it was hilarious but over time it wore off and now you see very few on the road. And I can say the same for the Mini Cooper. Now both of these are older vehicles that have been re-envisioned and yet they were iconic and people were excited to see them, so not brand new like the CyberTruck, but still will be the same feeling over time."
"Damn, Marques is good."
phenomenal video!
"I reached for my keyboard to comment about my experience owning a 1st year PT Cruiser and at that moment, you made the comparison.  My PT ended up being a lemon and it was bought back. I replaced it with a Grand Cherokee.  The novelty had worn off."
The most dangerous thing is the lack of crumple zone. But MKBHD is way too friendly to Elon to point that out.
That statistic about truck owners makes me wanna cry. That's another reason why prices are never going to go down. üò≠
This dude is such a tesla fanboy
When the production value and planning is so good - that you cannot stop watching the video on repeat. ‚òïÔ∏è
"Yes, it's ugly af."
How much were you paid by Tesla for this advertisement?
It's so dangerous it's banned in EU...
Mkbd must have gotten tesla shares to promote
Ooooo how we love a main channel video ‚ù§
Sounds like you own Tesla stock
"I live and Germany, and I'm VERY happy I'm never going to see it here"
21st century Delorean...
"I would say it is Infamous more then iconic. Also I am free to say it is ugly and will not spend that much money on something I see as ugly. Most people from what I see who are getting it are in the ""look at me camp"". It is impractical and roundabout paths had to be made to work around the horrible design. I want the engineering in something usable. So much wasted space...."
I wonder if Doug will start doing tech reviews now...
Can it handle an EMP grenade?
"This truck begs to be covered in camo vinyl, did you say Dbrand funded this episode.. lol."
Is Elon musk making a stealth car?.
MARQUES THE INTEGRATIONIST
"Cybertruck will become a meme in the future, for being a horrible ugly failure."
yes it is iconic. its also shit
As always great points and highland of the car
I really enjoyed that last bit about Iconic design.... The PT got crazy buzz and lines at the Chicago Auto Show.  And really it's meh.... This.... Well this might be something else.  I thought it was cool .. then it came out and I was thinking the Rivian looked better... Now you made it look cool again.  Keep up the great work...
It‚Äôs a electric El Camino. Nothing new to see here. This has already been done. It‚Äôs not a truck üòÇ
Cyberstuck
"Iconic?..it looks like a Chip Fryer...just a vanity project for People with an excess of Funds.
it is a slightly better design than the Sinclair C5."
Short cute chicks with daddy's money who don't know how to drive and can barely  reach the pedals are the main customers of trucks in Russia.
When people do it it's called peacocking. Does not mean it's iconic
Deutscher Frisbeesport-Verband e.V. FTW!
"Do not be fooled into thinking that because this car makes heads turn, it is desirable or good. A raving junkie in the corner of the train compartment will get the same reaction. This car's looks and resulting lack of safety sucks¬†‚Äî we all feel it. Don't let words like ""iconic"" erase that."
This vehicle would never be approved in EU.
"This car makes zero sense from a practical or aesthetic purpose for me as a consumer now that I know a lot about it (I put down a deposit way back when it was first announced btw). I'm also one of the millions of consumers who no longer wants to give Musk their money. If CyberTruck helps Tesla's evolution as a truck manufacturer, I could see the upside; like if there was a Model T Truck-Tesla next year that used the insights they gleaned from this monstrosity without being...this monstrosity."
a vehicle that makes people behave ü•¥
i hate the design
"i am really surprised by such a low views on this video even after 4 days, especially for an mkbhd video."
Its still hideous... people who have never seen are just shocked at how dumb it looks
This is one of the most high quality videos I‚Äôve ever seen
"Marques, what dirt does Elon have on you, mate? 

Blink twice if he is listening right now. . ."
An iconic car that rusts when it rains
"I think I understand why, access being super important and all that, but I‚Äôm still disappointed there wasn‚Äôt a bigger mention of all of the other reasons someone would give you a thumbs down besides ‚Äúcar ugly‚Äù. Like: driver safety, safety for other drivers on the road, escapability, material durability, service experience. You know, the things most people who are buying a car would want to know. There‚Äôs so much more to a car than ‚Äúwow fast nice screen!‚Äù And we shouldn‚Äôt review a car like it‚Äôs a phone, because it‚Äôs not."
I guess they cant believe how stupid someone can get to buy these üòÇüòÇ
Lol it sucks
"This car sucks, this guy always sucking apple and tesla off"
Bro is simping for Tesla. This car is trash.
Awesome video! Keep up the great work!
"PT Cruiser was the wrong comparison, shoulda been Plymouth Prowler..."
"Can‚Äôt wait for tesla to make it in green , remove the doors and strap a machine gun at the back. 

Then Master chief would be proud lol"
Great Video ! Iconic
I feel like with his look and the pause-- He said Iconic when he wood have rather said something like its a POS claptrap deathbox on wheels but at least its expensive...
I guess you don't know anyone that moves or works construction or does gardening or BIG shopping?  I rarely tow but always have had a truck for the utility of having the bed available.
"For next 1.April please make a review of a paper notebook with basicly endless battery life and ""it literally feels like paper "". And you can scan the paper to get it into the cloud! I would call it the IPaper Pro."
This feels like a paid advertisement
Great video
"Dude, you're literally a CT's salesperson 2mins into the video. It's a cringe."
"ugly car from a company notorious for poor manufacturing and quality control, fronted by one of the worst people in the world."
"no, it's not stock...üòÑ"
I like it. Every car looks the same. I love the difference. But the thing that's always put me off about having a fancy car is people rubber necking you. I prefer to be invisible.
10:04 that transition tho!!!!
"This isn't a review. It's a glorified ad. It mentions almost none of the myriad of critical issues in detail, just cramps a few of them in the summary in the end. It's extremely unsafe, it's poor quality, and most importantly it's an idiotic vehicle that has next to no realistic use case."
Please review the xiaomi car su7! Brilliant affordable car
"The mismatched finish from front to rear door, like the brushed finish runs in different directions, is differnt guage or whatever. It reflects light completely different and one seen, cannot be unseen."
Most people commenting here are special.. very special
Collab on tires?
Only a matter of time until the Police start driving the Cybertruck to patrol the city streets. üòä
eagerly waiting for a too much cinematic review from Brandon!
its pretty cool but would never buy one
"No, not iconic. It's a catastrophically abhorrently bad design from a technical perspective and should never be allowed on the streets and therefore will never make it to europe."
Looks like it has some serious blind spots
Testing 123
So how much did that more expensive 911 cost to beat the cyber try truck
now Tesal in my eyes are over raided. Dont have the range to match any pickup on the road. Margues ill take my 2011 F150 on the road to you. Then we will drive our own trucks on the same roads back to my home city bet you that ill get there days ahead of you an to make it fair ill tow a car behide me.
This video is spot on. Really well done.
"steer by wire is overrated because if your battery dies while driving, not only will you have no throttle, but you wont have any steering either, so instead of being able to pull off the road, you will crash because there is no way to control the vehicle."
The cybertruck‚Äôs eighth mile run is so quick that it the simulation couldn‚Äôt render its texture
Musk is a unstable fool. Until millions are delivered its all speculation that can go under
I'd  be more excited to see Marques behind the wheel
"As a full-size truck owner for the majority of my life, I can honestly say people buy big trucks for one overwhelmingly simple reason:  They're comfortable.  They're not some tiny thing with a harsh, uncomfortable ride, a cramped, claustrophobic interior, little to no headroom, and only space enough for a lunch box or two in the trunk.  Full-size trucks have a very smooth ride, they're quiet, there's plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, and if/when you need to haul or tow something, you've got that covered.  They're also extremely heavily built and thus pretty safe for those traveling within.  They've also come a long way in terms of design and environmental creature comforts.  They're just better in every way than they used to be 20-30 years ago.  They're also extremely reliable and will last a very, very long time. 

So, yeah, you can get a Raptor or a TRX if you've got the cash, and they're very capable of doing amazing things off road, but they probably never will.  They just look amazing, so people want them, and that's fine.  You don't have to need to haul or tow something in order to justify owning a truck that can do those things.  If you want a vehicle that's safe, comfortable (even luxurious in some trims), and more capable than most things on the road, you buy a full-size truck.  

The Tesla Model X has been gliding silently through my dreams for years now, and I would dearly love to have one.  The Cybertruck?  I actually like the design, but I don't like that they shrank it so much from the prototype.  I'm sure that won't change, but it'll be interesting to see what does change in the future as these things continue to be mass produced and evolve."
The Ford Pinto is iconic
Imagine how primitive you have to be in 2024 and have zero knowledge of the existence of a Tesla Cybertruck? LMAO
"Production quality wise it is the best MKBHD video but content wise it is not the best video far from it, lack of mention of security is concerning specially about pedestrian safety which needs to become  a discussing topic on such big channels"
there's no way a pt cruiser would be a similar comparison to a cybertruck no way...
crazy well done video
What an awesome honest review still love the cyber truck but I have a much more realistic idea of its capabilities.
"""it's not the lack of crumple zones.. oh wait yeah that is pretty dangerous actually."""
Yeh. It is ugly üòÇ
Sir please don't put tesla out of business too. RIP fisker
"What an AWESOME review, marquees!! Really different and insightful"
I hope Marques Brownlee can hire me to wash those cars before filming ....talk about job security ..take that AI lol ...great video MB
"MKBHD- please review Xiaomi SU7 - touted as wonder sports cars from China- specs of sports car  at a price of a sedan. If it's not available in the USA - please go to China üá®üá≥!! 
Are we entering into a new era of innovation??"
"NO. It's NOT going to be equivalent to a ""PT Cruiser"" in the future! How dare you, Brownlee"
Have you seen the recent Chinese EV cars?  Those are beautiful cars.  US is going crazy because ... it can.  US is like that spoiled kid who think he can do whatever it wants and the world will just OOOOHHHH and AAAAAHHH about him.  That is why something SO UGLY like this cyber truck exists.  It is UGLY!
I can't imagine being a refrigerator designer and being insulted this way on the regular. So harsh.
"Honestly, my biggest issue with the cyber truck (and tesla in general) is the choice to prioritize a gimmick over efficiency. EVs are at a point where efficiency should be the priority, so the choice to trade the efficiency for the shits and giggles of having a truck that looks like it has ps2 lara croft tiddy graphics isnt indicative of a company that actually cares about delivering the best products. I hope this is a one off with tesla."
idk how this shit is street legal
tesla shill
"If it were any other company, he would have criticized him severely"
I really hate this vehicle dawg. Like it's unhealthy how much i dislike it on every level
Cyber truck is iconic but this video was extremely Impressive! Great job
"Most people will look because they can‚Äôt believe people are that stupid. It‚Äôs not good, and history will judge it that way"

Hello I just need to say the production value of this video is absolutely next level!! You and the team do such an incredible job from creating such fun and engaging graphics to beautiful shots that are so simple but so well done! The intentionality of it all does not go unnoticed and it‚Äôs so fun to watch y‚Äôall continue to push the boundaries. Sending so much love and light! ü§ç
"I was surpised and also disappointed that the word ""security"" was never seriously mentioned. This review felt rather incomplete on more than one end."
"I can see how some people might like this, but to me it just looks like something from a Sega Saturn racing game."
I feel this combines well with the back to the future car

"""....my child...."""
Thanks Marques. Great review again. Cool and correct. Thanks for making and sharing.
Bad review.
"I don't know, MKB. I'm glad you noted the panel gap you found in the other video, but this seems a little ""fluffy"". Please tell me El*n didn't have a hand in this video..."
"rocking a German jersey while talking in front of a board, I like it
Greetings from Berlin"
"Video is amazing quality. The truck is meh, but that's just me, I'd buy any 911 any day of the week, to me that's iconic. The drive by wire is underrated but the truck overall is way too over rated and doesn't seem very safe but time will tell."
its like someone saw the delorean and wanted to make it not cool looking
"The most dangerous thing, is the gushing Fanboys."
"Remember the Hummer H1? That used to be cool too but quickly faded from sight because, like the cybertruck, it was an 8 foot wide monster, too big to be practical. Try parking it in a public lot between two cars. Impossible."
"I disagree marques, just because people won‚Äôt use it for its truck capabilities, doesn‚Äôt excuse it for not performing like a truck should. 

If I buy I lambo I‚Äôm most likely going to drive the speed limit, does that mean Lamborghini should make their cars slow? Hell nooo. 

The cyberTRUCK should perform as a truck should, and if it‚Äôs getting stuck in the snow then that‚Äôs an issue worth talking about."
"It‚Äôs the perfect plumbing truck
I can‚Äôt wait to serve my community"
"No it‚Äôs iconic like a jeep wrangler, still iconic even in mass"
Unobtanium. Avatar actually changed our language.
"It‚Äôs not good looking, marquees don‚Äôt fall for the Tesla manipulation cuz that‚Äôs literally a geometrical disaster. 

In no world does this look good"
Most dangerous thing is how budget Tesla was with this car. Can‚Äôt believe this shit is already rusting.
"Only ""iconic"" thing about this rust pile is that you can't buy it in EU, or, i think, even drive it. No EU safety standards, driver have to be C class drivers (vehicles over3.5 metric tons), no to mention it costs insane amount of money. Tnx, but i'll stick with my 15 year Skoda that costs to maintain like one tire of this pile of rust"
"I cant think of any iconic smart phone and this thing is like it. It will become oboslete, lost value and age like dog shit much  to fast..There is nothing iconic about any Tesla car, those are mass production, super minimalist, sterile designed cars that are at the start of development of EVs, if EV survive.. Iconic cars usually are tied to emotions, achivements and history and this thing is just to cold and bland for anything like that.. Its just big piece of tech and tech gets old soon as new comes out.."
It‚Äôs so unnecessary‚Ä¶ but it reflects a society where people by trucks to not carry anything
I want to imagine that the hand clapping sound at 17:25 genuinely perturbed Marques and he's going to try to solve it in future videos.
I feel like Jason Cammisa might disagree with you about a car needing to be rare to be iconic. But then I'm not Jason Cammisa.
"As with most internet things, passionate hate are merely a vocal minority. I‚Äôve loved the design from day one. My mom hates it, and neither of us are really truck people"
"No, they are looking at   Y O U   !!!!"
"I mean all other points aside, the notion that a hard exterior steel shell will keep you safe in the event of an accident is simply not true. modern cars are designed the way they are now to keep people safe at all costs. All energy created in a collision with this car will not be absorbed by the car and instead transmitted to the occupants causing injury when they would be walking away with scratches in a normal car."
It looks like the F-117 Nighthawk for the road.
"I'm tired of the excessive marketing and bizarre designs that seem irrelevant. The only noteworthy feature of this electric truck is its sheer power and speed. The rest, which garners so much attention, is simply irrelevant to me. And those who obsess over it, I can't help but question their judgement. MKBHD, with his endless videos praising the absurdly designed cybertruck more than any other vehicle, appears more like a covert marketer for these brands than an unbiased reviewer. The fascination with such an oddly shaped truck just baffles me."
It‚Äôs UAF
it is a horrible looking vehicle
"Hey Tesla I got an idea! Why don't we get rid of all the buttons and the screen too, and let the car be controlled on your phone with an app!!!"

"Masterclass Marques. The intro, the realisation, the quality all the highest level but the soundtrack selection...is lifting it up to one of the best tech or auto review in XXI. Take a bow MKBHD and the crew."
S24 ULTRA titanium grey.
Unfortunately the Lamborgini and the Bugatti were actual cars and not jokes like this truck.
"I wish my X had that steer-by-wire system.  The yoke looks much more useful with it.

BTW, most trucks in my neighborhood are very seldom driven off road.  They have off-road tire, but those are usually used to avoid need chains whengoing up skiing.  For most of the only think they haul are a few bags of mulch from Home Depot in the Spring."
"Might get a cyber truck in 2-3 years from now, all I want is a door handle"
Can this guy stop milking this awful car? Let's find out.
No offense but this video sounds exactly like an advertisement. Your last video was a true review.
"VW Bug is iconic, once it was noteworthy but not for long.  Even the VW van was ""Iconic"".  When it becomes common it's normal and no longer 'special'.  
PT Cruiser had nothing but dubious style to offer, nothing special about it under the skin, just a cheesy, tinny Chrysler."
Antti-aliasing turned off.
The doors look discolored.
It does look so stupid..
"not a single thing about safety huh, weird"
"I personally think it's a Pos, and would not even look at it if it pulled up beside me. The muskateers aren't going to save the planet with that useless, toy."
When u have too much money you stop thinking what people actually want from your product...this is what happened to elon....1 day nature will teach him.
How can a slowdown in production make the excess in production and lack of sales better? Despite production slowdowns they still overproduced. Tesla have a big brand issue.
"I can imagine as a biker that the cyber truck is pretty terrifying. Tesla being all about safety, I nevertheless expect crashes to be absolutely horrifying. Not for the driver themself of course, but the victim."
Another Cybertruck video? Brought to you by Elon Musk?
Excellant presentation!!! Thanks so much
how many tesla shares do you own? also iconic is also ford pinto who can forget it a case study. LOL
"I think it would be better if it was smaller, like the size of the ford maverick. That would help with the safety concerns of injurying others."
How is this Cybertruck's fault lmao
What is the current average auto loan rate now?
"I'm European so I can add a different view on American trucks and Tesla fan-boys...

"Hate all you want, they do look cool in person. To me I think it so strange how so many are so quick to hate Dare to Be Different. It's futurist, why hate that?"
it's backed by the most divorced dad of all time ü§Æ i could never
"How do you think preorders would be different if instead they made the thing out of carbon fiber, with a more traditional but aerodynamic (think R1T) design?"
Having two cybertrucks in the same review is the biggest flex
"Well... there is a bit of Tesla BS marketing that hasn't been covered:

1) they had to order stronger stamping presses, than they had... compared to the available presses, the ones for automotive sheet metal are on the medium size side of things. So ordering a new set for thicker sheet metal was more or less a matter of placing an order.

2) the adaptive steering is also possible the same way with traditional steering racks. Making it drive by wire has other benefits - and drawbacks.
Tesla chose this configuration, because they had to save weight and keep within a reasonable turning circle.
My Touareg has adaptive steering and all wheel steering, which results in a turning circle of a VW Golf."
"So I didn't watch many videos on the cybertruck, and only because you did one did I watch the whole thing. Honestly I think this was a great video."
Iconic my a$$
Tin Box has a new name.....Cybertruck
You are playing for a German Frisbee Team?
"@brownlee not to be a nitpicker, but that trailer carrying the 911 is speed limited by its tires (around 120 mph I‚Äôm guessing). The Cybertruck is speed limited and reaches its max speed by the 1/8 mile mark.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how quick a car is if you make the course long enough where speed will win out - in this case 1/4 mile."
"this truck is a death machine. Like truck culture doesn't kill enough children and cyclists in the US. this will add to the tally. good design? It's a fad. It's different for the sake of being different. it's a step back to the ""prehistoric"" ages of car building"
Why are people acting like the truck is so heavy?  Gas trucks can weigh up to 7-9K lbs...and they don't even have a battery or a steel exoskeleton.
still better than apple products
Iconic? That thing is crazy shitty.....
"John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life."

such promo for the elon truck :(
Please support me
Nissan was first to do steer by wire. Their backup was a floating steering column which locked into place upon failure of the electronics. So people claiming Nissan ddin't have true STW are wrong.
"Since you own both trucks, Tesla & Rivian, in terms of drivability, which is better? I don't mean outright speed but daily livability?"
14:03 is one of the most epic shots
That intro my god‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"Gees oh man, that Intro. Sick!"
I love the esthetic. My issue with it id for different things
"Amazing insights you make! I wish you could also test some of the European EV: Skoda Enyaq, Peugeot i3008, Renault Sc√©nic e-Tech"
It‚Äôs hideous
"I do think it‚Äôs trajectory is similar to the PT Cruiser. At the moment of mass production. It will become pretty irrelevant. Simply based on the time it took to go from presentation, to first delivery to mass production. And in the end the corners cut will hurt the cyber truck,"
"Gaphics, there near intro is insane !"
"on a side note, if i am a rich oil boss, i would pay people to come to famous channels like this and talk crap about the car. seriously."
Kinda disappointed that the rear view mirror isn‚Äôt a camera screen like some newer cars.
I believe that lexus created the steer by wire first. Unless that electric car they had been working on isn't out yet Rz and I guess toyota bz? Check em out.
"Big ego mobile. Just do some therapy, its going to be cheaper"
"This car is peak ‚Äúfuck-you-me-first‚Äù-mentality. All benefits of driving electric being lost, only to stroke your ego, a dangerous tank that destroys everything in an accident just to keep yourself safe. Plus - a waste of parking space in any city. I was a big fan when it came out because of the design choices and the engineering behind it, but I‚Äôm grateful it will never really be road legal in Europe."
just wait until someone is split in half by this car.
"Good point at the end around being iconic. I remember when the Tesla S first came out. It was considered Luxury, High-Class, and Rare at first. Now living in OC, Teslas are more seen than any other car. The ""Iconic"" view of it is washed away by the common-ness of it. Same will happen with the cybertruck. And because of the already ""50-50"" view of the design, that number will slowly change over time."
Cars being rare doesn't always means good because they may be simply failed sales.
Steer by wire! Been around for a long time bro
"When I think about the cyber truck I think of the word Beta.

Beta tester
Beta male"
"Hello sir, i am a medical student in India and need a tablet (any note taking and processing device) can you please help me! You do a lot of giveaways, i hope you'll consider it. Please reply!!"
"*AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH        $100,000 AND THE DOOR LATCH IS HELD ON WITH GAFFA TAPE...!!!*

The most insane thing I have ever heard of - who did the quality control for this - Boeing...???"
"*STEER BY WIRE* is underrated until the truck is 7 years old and then its going to be a living he!! - or more likely a d-y-i-n-g he!!

There is NO WAY I am buying a second-hand vehicle with steer by wire - I've had many S-Class Mercedes and the electronics are a nightmare of a ‚Ç¨150k Mercedes after 5 years."
The review space is sweet! Beats your parking lot hands down
I know everyone hates the looks but Ive wanted one of these since it got revealed. It's so different
if you are on the road you are using it wrong...
I was not ready for the sledgehammer to come out lol üòÇ
No
Holy. The production quality of this video is insane - felt like the top gear of tech videos
Your car reviews are terrible.
rusting whale with no towing and no offroad ability.
Impressed! So articulate üòÇ
"""I'm getting dump truck vibes from back here"" is a sentence I wish I heard more often üòî"
"MKBHD being biased af, Tesla fan boy review. Call a spade a spade. This dangerous minimalist abomination of a vehicle with touch everywhere and oh a software steering that you advertised so well. What happens when eventual bugs keep crawling in the system. I am biased and say I hate it. But the amount of Tesla dickriding Marques does is on another level"
"Yeah, american vehicle designs are not known for their beauty, quality or safety. 
Musk grabbed preliminary styling sketches from nearest kindergarten. Got a Design department somewhere in darkest Africa to bang up production documentation using 2D CAD."
I've never seen one of your videos prior to this and the Pixel Fold video (which is how I found your channel). Your videos are so well thought out and you're so pleasant to listen to - it's refreshing to see a person so young with qualities that make intelligent humans (thinking about the endless nonsense that exists on TikTok & IG). You know what you're talking about and you narrate in probably the best way I've seen in a long time on YouTube. Definitely subscribed and looking forward to catching up on all the videos you've made already. Not at all surprised at the 18.6 MILLION subscribers you have. Just truly great content.
Stains if it gets wet‚Ä¶. supreme engineering!1
I would buy one if I had enough money!
Steer by wire sounds a lot like the system used in aircraft where they removed mechanical linkages like pulleys and chains and replaced it by Fly by Wire
We need your new review on tesla FSD!! It‚Äôs getting better and better
TELL ME BOUT A PT CRUISER
Just no.  As I kid I put iconic cars on the wall of my bedroom as motivation.  If I saw a kid nowadays with a cybertruck posters all over his wall I'd think we reallllly lowered the bar.  Your anecdotal evidence for the 80/20 spit on how people will react is also horribly bad.
How many more videos about cybertruck are we going to have to see on this channel
This should be Robocop‚Äôs ride.
The Starting Animation & Sound is way more Cooler then Entire Video.... Love it
Didnt we do this already?
That car is horrible mate
man it wasn't the truck it's you people all over the work know you
"So I get you are a mad Tesla fan boy, but I'm surprised you didn't say ANYTHING about the potential for rust in the stainless steel body.  Not a car for Australia, or anyone living within 2 kms of the ocean"
What's the song at the end
"17:20 No it's not stock? 140 MP/h is definitely stock for anything with a Porsche badge... My diesel BMW 5-series is limited at 155 MP/h. And yes, that's GPS, so it says 265 kph on the speedo.
And also the cyclist - I completely get it. A car crash with a cybertruck will most probably kill the cyclist.

And to your reference to the Countach - it looks amazing, it drives horribly. And the Veyron actually has at least 900 produced, probably a few more. You will probably find 100 already in Monaco, another 100 in Dubai and at least a dozen in Hong Kong."
"cmmon, as a German I just have to say it: it¬¥s engineering trash"
Yes it's looks bad in design
Great video as always man! Are you planning on taking it on some off road driving? I‚Äôve seen people complaining about the cyber truck performance bugs there and it‚Äôd be nice to see a more reliable review on that
We all know what the most important feature of the CyberStuck is. Its ability to break down anywhere without warning because it's badly designed.
Miles couldn't get to drive the porsche
This thing is dangerous and should be illegal. Looks like it is designed to kill cyclists and pedestrians
"EVERY THING ABOUT THIS STUPID ""TRUCK"" IS DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARE! 136,000 DOLLARS CANADIAN WOULD BE HALF THE PRICE OF A HOUSE IN WINNIPEG MANITOBA CANADA!"
"Absolutely love the video, team.  Informative, great videowork and editing and it feels like an honest look. Great work."
Five guys is super expensive and yet they still have a spot to ask for tips for their employees. Why doesn't five guys pay a fair wage
"‚ÄúIf somebody hits you, you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù I‚Äôm sure the family of 4 in their Fiat punto will be overjoyed to hear that."
I have more respect for Fred Flintstone his car that matches the time design lol üëç
Steer by wire existed for ages. 2006 Ford Escape Hybrids had drive by wire. Georgia Tech used that and 4 Mac minis to win 3rd in the DARPA urban challenge.
"Saw my first one today in person in Tucson, AZ. Looks much bigger and longer than the videos make it look. Can‚Äôt believe someone would buy one of these‚Ä¶must need attention since they don‚Äôt get it from their families üòÇ"
Love the Auto Focus license plate‚ù§
Elon claiming that ‚Äòonly 15 Cybertrucks have the door gap issue‚Äô means it‚Äôs definitely a widespread issue.
Intro no good do better
ppl using it as a glorified suv is actually not so cool bc that thing weighs alot more than gas pickup trucks cause its electric.
gaff tape on the 100k brand new truck is so hilarious to me
14:01 definetely flexing lmao
10:05 What a nice shoot too
üò∂
I‚Äôve seen it a bit in L.A. it‚Äôs terrible looking and the paint is hideous.
"Ford Taurus... also iconic. 
Pontiac Aztek
Dodge Neon
Dodge Viper
and how could be forget the VW Beetle"
That intro went haaard
"top gear didnt thrash all those cars around a track in their reviews because buyers were actually going to do that with the product, they were trying to assess how good the car was at doing car stuff; cornering, comfort, fun. To say that it doesnt matter that this truck is bad at truck stuff; towing, range, offroading, because most customers never do that stuff is a bit silly imo, especially when tesla continues to claim class-leading competency in these areas. 
Most customers of the 911 will not track it or command its full potential, but they buy 911s because they are nonetheless best at sports car stuff and you would not reccommend that I buy a golf GTI instead because I'm 'not gonna use that stuff anyway'"
Marquez pls make a video about Suno AI next
ad before the sledgehammer is CRAZY
Iconic = MKBHD
"an iconic rust bucket, a gigantic failure, designed by a man-child."
Basically no mention of safety when this thing is a literal tank? ok. As a human being I hate how big and dangerous these monstrous vehicles are becoming
Can confirm the PT Cruiser thing.
So far I haven't seen a Cybertruck on the Street yet..!!! Autoshow Yes! But Not OUT on the Street...
Like when the 1998 Volkswagen Beetle came out
"Bunch of Karens in the comment section. It‚Äôs new, of a design, to technical and to high tech for the close minded brain"
Internet people say the truck is great so they can sell this crap when it loses popularity
26:23 pt cruisers were so cool when they came out. Then they just because bland and went away. I remember them well.
23:10 those wheel covers will most likely cause the brakes to overheat and fail. Trucks too heavy and the breaks are going to get worked. Holding in that heat isn‚Äôt ideal.
"You can be iconic without being rare. take the mini cooper or the Fiat 500.

PS great video, keep up the good work!"
Already irrelevant.
"Not good looking, but is unique..."
"LOL, ""no arirplay of android auto"" such a funny review"
"0:12 there are so many cars with a curved chrome piece on the back that blind me, why is it aloud to for designers to put a literal mirror on the car that is curved so that it can reflect the sun into your eyes from any angle"
"Back in the 70s and 80s a major criticism of North American cars was the over focus on style, while ignoring how a vehicle did its job.

So cars were larger than they needed to be in order to accomplish their purpose. Thus the move from 70s boats to smaller 80s cars with similar interior space,  better build quality, and higher efficiency.

Basically, what I'm saying is that the Cybertruck is the equivalent of a 1976 Cadillac convertible with horns on the hood (check out Boss Hogg's Cadillac in The Dukes of Hazzard).

It's all about style, with no attention paid to functionality. It's a joke. 

By contrast, the typical truck is a testament to form following function.

And the whole acceleration thing is massively overblown. While every car guy/girl loves speed and power, you're talking about performance you can't use, but which will drain the battery even faster.

Which brings me to the question of environmental concerns.

How is a truck that is grossly overweight, has limited cargo space and capacity relative to similarly sized real trucks, and is shaped like a building in any way environmentally responsible?

It's laughable.

Is it a technical tour de force? Yes. But anyone trying to argue that there's any rational basis for buying this thing is kidding themselves. It's the equivalent of saying a Mustang is a legitimate family car because it has vestigial rear seats.

The Cybertruck is a ""pickup"", but only in the loosest sense."
How fast does this thing eat up tires? EVs burn through tires. Needing changed 20% more often and costing 50% more. I have to believe the cybertruck EATS tires.
This is the ugliest truck ever made by humans no matter how much Elon pays you.
Miles setting a world record without knowing
That's a shameful biased review.
"It looks like a car you find in a PS1 game, it has a very polygonal shape."
"The U.S. truck makers keep trying to come up with something uglier, but so far.......not even close."
you're underrated Marques
"I love everything about how this video was shot and edited other than this, but does anyone feel like there was an almost uncomfortable amount of blur around the edges of some shots? There were a few shots, particularly scenes of Marques speaking directly to the camera, where I almost felt like squinting because it didn't feel sharp."
Day 1 of asking Marques Brownlee for a Smartphone
"Even if Tesla used the cheapest 911, the Porsche is still at least $25,000 more than the CyberBeast."
glad someone is addressing this.
10:56 Didn't someone drown in a Tesla a while back? Because the door wouldn't open?
"you def got paid to make this there's no way,, and steer by wire bruh lexus has already put those in their production evs, there's nothing impressive about this car besides making people scratch their heads"
"Not it's not fine that people are gonna use this as a glorified SUVs. Massive cars like this are so dangerous, they ruin our cities, they take up way too much space for a single person, and oh did I mention that they're extremely dangerous?? Anyone who thinks that it's ok to be driving around in a ""glorified SUV"" just because they want to care about themselves, and don't care at all on the impacts they have on others."
"They're behaving this way because they think this guy is Usher, and the Puff Daddy scandals aren't helping."
ok... iconic=fancy/expensive car? We already have an iconic (and cheap) car well spread among the masses. VW beetle... so it's nothing new in that sense
In NorCal I‚Äôve seen almost 20 of them already. Reminds me of the first teslas. Cyber trucks will absolutely be everywhere sooner than we think
You know what's iconic. Mile is
No comments on the safety?
"Exactly how it was when I got the Model 3 before anyone had one or driven one , NOW thats all you see on the road"
People talk to me about my 2022 Honda civic hatchback too
Man I just want to get places safely that's all. Who cares what you drive. I look down on people who buy this stupid truck.
"Marques Brownlee, this comment is extremely important for you. Being a fan of your content for a long period, it's my responsibility to reveal the truth to you. There is no GOD but Allah, and Muhammad ( SAW ) is the last messenger of Allah. Just read the Quran for once, a learned personality like you will know what's the truth."
"if i controlled rewind, i would want fortnite and marques brownlee"
Bad Ass Truck.
"The worst part of the looks of the Tesla Cybertruck is that if any other car manufacturer makes a wild, basic, minimalist looking vehicle now... EVERYONE will cry that they are a Tesla copy cat."
It‚Äôs a mall crawler. Like a jeep wrangler.
"If they ever make it back to the future remake, this should be the vehicle they use. Plus the stainless steel would help with the flux dispersion."
911 iconic and mass produced though
I hope you‚Äôre enjoying these easy money
"I think a couple things you may have missed in your evaluation. Number one the fact that it‚Äôs bulletproof just really shows you how tough the outer skin is you didn‚Äôt mention it‚Äôs the first vehicle on the road made with an exoskeleton and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs bulletproof and by the way to make a truck bulletproof cost $70,000 if you have that done yourself. Number two the fact that it‚Äôs iconic it‚Äôs iconic because it doesn‚Äôt look like every other pick up truck out there and now all the other manufacturers know they don‚Äôt have to keep trucks looking the same. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna make it iconic."
14:14 MKBSD
"5:30 Someone needs to tell Marques to adjust his mirrors properly. You shouldn't be able to see the side of your car in your mirrors, they should be adjusted to see your blind spot. Look up the Car and Driver ""How To Adjust Your Mirrors to Avoid Blind Spots"" article."
Paint it matte black
Great video !
do you feel bad at all for killing Fisker and costing the investors millions of dollars?
"For being so blunt with the Fiskar it's real interesting how lenient he was about Tesla's """"""Clever"""""" advertising. 


How about the clever little hundreds of miles of range missing? How about the safety ratings? How about the ""don't let the indestructable truck get wet in the sun or it will be permanently stained?""

Is he just embarrassed because he already bought the top of the line model?"
Great AutoFocus video. Keep it up
The 911 Turbo S is way faster than a regular 911. Way faster.
"The acceleration and hard, angular exterior is going to be disastrous for accidents. The agility too. If it feels like a sports car to drive, people are going to drive it like a sports car and get into accidents  - and if that's with a pedestrian or small car, the cybertruck will just cut right through them. Also doesn't help that the cybertruck owners won't even have to worry about damaging their own vehicle in a crash.
Things like this might be cool in movies or as off-road experiments, but as a road legal vehicle this is a horrible idea."
how did this car ever pass safety rule? if you get hit ur dead. and the car is useless isnt it? a pickup truck is a actual usable truck
you reviews are always so profesional. amazing production.
I saw one driving on the Northway the other day that would be 87 New York. The license plate was from New Jersey there might have been going to the Adirondacks I don't know. I feel like it looks like a El camino. A very modernized or brutalist El Camino. Also the sound it made was really loud; it reminded me either of a Battlestar Galactica Cylon or would I imagine a UFO would sound like.
"6:55 Demolition Ranch, we‚Äôre waiting on you Matt üòÇ"
Infiniti was the first to steer by wire and everyone hated it.  Because it‚Äôs a Tesla everyone loves it.
Most truck people I know work corporate jobs. I am not a pickup truck person but I‚Äôd buy a Cybertruck as my first
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Cyber truck danger üòÇüòÇ
"i live in california, i seen at least 5 cyber trucks a month all throughout where im going day by day."
Iconic like the Pontiac Aztek
"The most dangerous part is the flat front of the car. The reson cars have a pointy front and not a wall is because it reduces fatalites when head on collisions happend. If hit by a pointy car a person flyes up on the front and into the glass pannel that shatters, but with a steel wal they just absorbe all of that r√∂relse energi. Its like if a brick wall is shot at you by a big fucking cannon. These cars are idiotic and dangerous, but then again so is every car."
7:11 should have done the invisible logo thing from the animation
"So basically it's a piece of ""bleep"" by the fantasist Musk."
"That was an interesting chart (How F150 owners use their truck).  Here's one other consideration, when you need to tow something substantial, you REALLY need a truck.  You can't rent a truck unless you sign an agreement that you won't tow anything.  So while only 7% of F-150 owners use their truck for towing, there is no other option.  As far as personal hauling, it's the same thing.  Making renovations to your house?  You need something that can haul a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood, drywall, etc.. I did that with a 20 year old Honda Pilot, a full size SUV, but most SUVs now are too small.
So for occasional use the Cybertruck that rides like a nice car is cheaper on fuel than any ICE, roomier than most vehicles and will eventually be reasonably priced, why would you want anything else?  
Here's why not!  It doesn't have that much range.  If Tesla would have kept their promise of close to 500 miles of range then you would get 200 miles of range while towing in the winter, (loose 50% for towing 10,000 lb holiday trailer and another 10% for winter driving).
If they can get the Tesla Semi to have 500 miles of range with a GVW or 80,000 lbs, they could have done it with a CT and a GVW or 30,000 lbs."
"In capitalist America, $80,000 death trap drives you!"
What about the rust
The most dangerous thing about it is how you can slice your fingers on the frunk
Man quit hyping up this trash
Iconic like the Hummer i would say.
"This guy really has no idea about technology, and certainly not about cars. Just empty words. You can't believe he has so many subscribers."
This truck will one day probably kill me in a car accident driven by a drunk driver and I don't feel safe sharing the road with it.
"It could also be like the VW Beetle. Iconic, to this day."
Iconic? No.
Iconic cuz it sucks and is so unnecessarily stupid looking. Also the ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù stink
Great takes. It‚Äôs so nice to see someone unbiased and putting in their due diligence to provide quality info.
"The guy on the bicycle probably saw his impeding death. 
Just looking at those edges. 
I wouldn't want that standing still on a road I bike, let alone drive."
If it's a refrigerator on wheels then put the refrigerator magnets on it. I want to see those ABCs and 123s all over
"it isn't good looking. and, living in CA, once you see it for the 10th time, it looks rather silly. the design is unique but i don't predict it will age well. it will be forever planted in 2024 and will define this decade of car design, good or bad. beyond that, it's ""meh"" after you've seen a few of them."
13:25 millions? Then they will have to become a lot cheaper! (And more practical)
"Back in 2014 would see few Tesla‚Äôs driving around the Bay area, rare and a neck turner. Within the past week seen about 15 Cybertrucks between the Fremont plant and La Mirada in LA. Sooner than later ill see them more often. (Just like the model S back in 2014)"
"Well even bad cars or failures can be iconic, just look at the Aztec or the Pacer or the Trabant üòÖ"
Perfect two words. Visually interesting. I personally love it.
"ü§ì: Fingerprints?!

üòè: Slap in a Dbrand skin on it üòÇ"
Towing is not the only thing you want a truck for... hauling gear in the bed is something you use on a much more regular basis.
"I don't think you're a reliable tech reviewer anymore Marques and I'll tell you why: You ripped apart Fisker Ocean for simply stupid reasons that can be easily fixed with a software update, but the Cybetruck is a piece of garbage full of issues, not to mention it's ugly and impractical, yet you barely said anything negative about it. Clearly a Tesla(?)/Musk(?) fanboy, or paid for? Something along those lines. As far as the Cybertruck goes, maybe it's time to stop the mass delusion and admit that it is a tin can on wheels."
"My GF hadn't heard about the Cybertruck (HOW??). She saw one next to her at a traffic light and sends me a pic with a message: ""Are we at war? Why is there a really futuristic looking tank next to me"". I died laughing üòÇ"
"Being 100k with a 250 mile range, horrific build quality, and looking like a special ed kid drew it in crayon is bad enough.... but the interior is like a work truck trim level ffs. You dont even have dash guages just a shitty little tv bolted onto the center. Its complete trash. Must be nice to have 100k+ to throw at a status symbol just to have normal people point and laugh at everyone who bought this thingüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Hitlers mustache is also iconic. doesnt mean good
You can tell a lot of work went into making this video. üëèüèæ great work
that intro straight üî•
"This is a bad truck.  Avoid.  It's a shameful that it's allowed on public roads, along with the usual underused suv's and trucks"
$100k and some bolts fall out.
That dent after the sledgehammer üò©
"I think the kind of person who buys a Rivian EV truck is very different from a person who buys a Cybertruck.  BTW, I was very excited to see Rivians in the wild three years ago and took pictures of them and talked to the owners. Now I see them regularly and they are just another part of the street scape. However, they don't loudly scream out the owner's personality like the Cybertruck or any version of the Hummer, EV or ICE. Those are loud statement of identity vehicles. Thanks for warning us about who and what you are.üôÑ"
"Came to watch the cybertruck's review, ended up falling in love with the 911's sound"
"It's not feet, it's meters."
Model X owners disagree with low VIN issues üòÖ
cybertruck has the wow factor
"I love the PT Cruiser reference! I wanted one so bad! Haha. I loved the que ball shifter on the manuals! I have my reservation for the cybertruck and am willing to wait for it to become available. Hopefully my Tesla M3P will be paid off by then, LOL! Whatever you want to call this thing.. I love it!"
I‚Äôm waiting for the Matte Black Wrap!
This thing is just too bizarre.Just a matter of time before Tesla kills it.
hmm claiming it sucks for towing then watching other chancels where they tow a rivian on a trailer through the rocky mountains... hmm again
The Porsche 911 is an iconic design despite there being so many of them. I think the Cybertruck will become a new norm and force manufacturers to reimagine what a pickup is.
"I'm not at home in manufacturing nor the english language, but I believe they're not ""stamping"" the stainless steel, as you said multiple times. They're just bending it. This is actually the main reason for the crazy shape. You can't just stamp the sheet metal into any shape because it's too strong. Only bend straight edges, then glue or weld the pieces to the body."
"I saw a cyber truck on Easter at church, and two old people immediately waved and took pictures of it. First time I‚Äôve seen one, pretty cool"
You omitted to point out and comment on numerous issues and criticisms about the car. Terrible video.
"Iphone 1 was mass produced, but it is still iconic"
Not to do with the truck unfortunately but does anyone know the brand of that blue hoodie?!
The only good thing about this monstrosity is knowing that its banned in Europe and I never have to encounter one in my life.
That truck is hideous in person. I've seen 4 so far and they all look dirty regardless. It looks like a doorstop with wheels.
Weird discoloration along the door lines. This thing is so stupid.
This truck is crying for a durable clear-coat paint finish ‚Äì opaque-gloss or clear-coat-matalic.
"The reason you get a ton of comments disliking it online because 
1- They hate Elon Musk and anything he does because of all the sensationalized and fake news around him for being part of a cultural war.
2- People who comment very often do so to complain. There are way more people complaining about other's opinions because everyone needs their own views being validated with like and comments agreeing with them, otherwise people just go ""yeah that's about right"" in their head and move on with their life.
3- Lots and lots of people, growing with time, just hate, deeply hate electric cars because they don't make sound, because they're popular right now, because for some reason they believe it's a government's plot to have them stuck in a short range of 300 miles (vast majority of people don't move from a 20 miles radius daily and city dwellers don't even move 10 miles away from home)
4-Did i mention they hate Elon?"
i love it
"How the fuck is this allowed on the streets? aren't cars made to fold in and collapse on themselves to help absorb impact in accidents? If you get hit by a Cybertruck, you are not walking away from that shit."
My cousin is a photographer in LA California and his justification for the cybertruck was that its the only car that can store his gear ever since car breakings became a common thing. Think your missing that point for its toughness
The cybertruck would look really good with a mounted chaingun
"You will *not* be fine if you're hit, either by or in this vehicle. Bulletproof stainless steel? There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago, and that's cuz during a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. That's why the hood and trunk of a car is made of aluminum. So that in the event of a crash it'll absorb the impact first instead of the human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.

Of course, this does come with a downside. You get into a minor crash nowadays, and your car's almost guaranteed to be totaled. But that's also the point. You want the car to crumple around the humans as much as possible so the human doesn't die. It's like that one high school project some kids do where you have to drop an egg in a basket from a roof without having the egg crack by wrapping it in soft stuff like toilet paper. You know what'll happen if you put the egg in a stainless steel bottle then drop it from the roof? That egg's exploding. 


When cars were made of steel accidents at what would be considered low speeds today were still dangerous af. Nowadays you get into an accident at 60 MPH and unless you're unlucky or T-boned people are usually not too badly injured. This monstrosity? Bro hitting a wall at 30MPH will be the equivalent of you sprinting faster than Usain Bolt straight into a wall. Not scary with a normal car, potentially fucking fatal with this shit."
Tesla tested a base 911. You tested a 911 Turbo. Big difference.
"It's simply the most groundbreaking design ever. Quite apart from the fact that it is an EV.
Then it's got 48V.
It's stainless steel.
It's got a tonneau cover.
It's fast.
It's a TESLAüòÖ"

Did we just see how iconic the iPhone is?
Volkswagen Beatle.
Just came to this comment section to ask: *No April 1st video?*
i think its ugly but agree with him that from the front it looks kind of good. but being ugly doesnt mean it cant be iconic since its still something people havent seen even with all the cars and supercars available today.
.. the first seconds of the vid are proof that we¬¥re living in zombie-nation .. and things are just starting .. welcome to hell :-D
"iconic bullshit, yeah."
Mom's spaghetti
"Front looks good, backside.. aaa..."
i love the cybertruck so so much! looks amazing!!
"Personally, i don't think it will go the way of the PT cruiser but more of the iconic VW Beetle bus.  Tesla makes technology cars, that push the envelope and continue to get better with time!"
"Cybertruck will be iconic, but not everywhere. Those countries that will never see these on the road‚Ä¶ It will be iconic, for sure."

"When I first saw the back of the Cybertruck, I thought Pontiac Aztec. I‚Äôve since grown to love it. One will show up in my garage someday."
The most dangerous thing definitely is the size shape and speed though. This truck is a pedestrian-killing machine
Why do all tech guys have a tesla kink? You were able to ignore it but now they brought it to the car reviewing scene
Tesla are not the first to make a drive by wire system.
This was so well made. I think Marques' love for Tesla shows off in all the review/overview videos made by him for their products.
"I‚Äôve been driving mine around for three weeks now and can vouch that this video is 100% accurate on all counts. 

After getting in my beloved M3 to test out the latest drop of FSD 12.3, the steering felt archaic. üòÇ"
Heyyyy Marques is doing puff pieces for Elon and Cybertruck
"Overall, overrated."
"If Elon Musk shits into card boxes and puts in a nice design on the boxes and has a huge press release praising how amazing, modern and futuristic those shitboxes are and all the quirks the boxes have, it will sell millions."
Comparing the cyber truck to the PT cruiser is offensive.  Imagine how all the engineers feel that worked hard to make this truck a reality - and they gave you one early!  The metal panels and all wheel steering are badass.  Guess add MB to ignore list
It is roll and pitch motion
I'd appreciate more on Rivian
I would say the VW Beetle was iconic and mass produced
"The BRZ, FRS, GT86, GR86,  etc is steer by wire and no one complained about it, it's great."
all cars go to hell
"I'm not so sure about the winter capability the headlights get covered with snow because the front bumper creates a shelf for snow to sit on, the rear camera gets covered in snow and road salt spray, and it doesn't have a cleaning mechanism like the front camera so in winter you'll have to drive with the tonneau cover down and that's just regular winter driving stuff"
"Lets be honest this truck is trash looking, no sugarcoating"
"Mass Produced Iconic Cars:
Toyota Corolla Sprinter Trueno / Levin AKA Corolla GT  AE86
Toyota GT86
Toyota Supra
Toyota MR2
Toyota Celica
Nissan 200SX / 180SX S13-S15
Nissan Skyline GT-R R32-R34
Nissan 300Z Fairlady
Ford Mustang Fastback 60s
Charger, Challenger, Camaro of the yester years etc etc etc.
etc etc etc the list just goes and goes and goes"
I actually see them pretty often in Texas
Look at it...its not from earth üòÇ
"It's iconic as in iconicly bad. It's a truck that is designed to not be a truck. It's unsustainable and unsafe. The only interesting thing about it is the steering, but that also feels a bit sketchy."
"well, why wouldn't someone be ignoring clowns riding a refrigerator on wheels?"
"""well i just happen to own a 911 and a cybertruck......"" such an awesome non-flex but also flex"
And that's why I subscribed mkbhd.
You want a physical key to open the truck ??? Seriously I cant believe we arent already using the phone as key for all cars. The minimalism is wonderful.
I saw one the other day. I had mixed feeling about it. It looks cool but also looks like a fridge on wheels. üòÖ
"Saw you in Wayne the other day. Love the CyberTruck. Route 280 in a few shots. Love you brother, been a sub when u 1st started."
So much bullshit.
"I think it will age more like a beetle. Just a unique car, while one of the most mast produced cars ever made over the longest time span of any production vehicle, but still cool"
Yes but is it an ionic? Nope only Hyundai gots them.
"It looks like it was imported from Mars, and has Martian aerodynamics. Despite whether we like it or not, it will affect the vehicles designed in the future, and that's a good thing IMO because car manufacturers are playing it safe and their only trick is making it bigger and slightly different than a last year's most popular model was."
"Good review!  The high water shot brought up a question: if the truck were to ever be submerged accidently, how is someone to get out?  The windows are nearly unbreakable, right?  Is it still breakable with an escape tool?"
It's a awesome looking car
"Only thru the intro, and I;m hooked"
Cybertruck cut the vegetable
It was a comment that struck me when I read it. Was saying that ok Elon did that but most of it is scary that what other cars company will see it. And is ugly ok but hopefully other cars company won't go that path as the truck we see it nowüò¢
It's a funny looking El Camino with four seats. Not that that's a bad thing.
Get the cyber truck in all black. Just about anything looks good in all black
Iconic fail.
This shit with EV cars most stop.
Not MKBHD flexing his rides üòÜ
The biker was just scare of loosing his life in an accident
"Absolutely stunning. I can sit through your videos even if they are an Hour long. You know why, because you don't bullshit, you tell everything as it is."
Production quality on this video is great üëç
so jealous of that turn ratio... my tahoe feels like im rolling the waverunner on to its station every time i need to make a turn
Very good review MKBHD.
Its great
"Hi, Great video Mar-Q-B!! love the Cyber Truck, will love to have a glance at it in real life, but that's a long shot (being that I am from rural part of Africa), any ways some day, someday........"
Motorized morgue tables.
Lol he is spicing things up
Marques sounds like a paid shill shilling so hard. It's Emperor's New Clothes.
Great review
üóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏è
"I think the big difference between opinion from a biker and a few people in a car is the fact that a biker's first reaction to this design and material choice is, if it touches you, the best case scenario is severe injury, but most probably fatal. And that is a big problem with it, wouldn't be surprised if it got 0 stars on the NCAP pedestrian safety test."
"No, not already iconic. It‚Äôs already ironic. üòÇ"
"Not shocked most people havent heard of the cyber truck, because most people don't live online like Twitter/X likes you to think."
"Miles is sooooo cooool, goodnesss"
"It's a symbol for wasteful, unsafe and ugly design,. Worst car of the century in many ways, just innately stupid."
"apparently the Cybertruck isn't allowed in Switzerland because ""too dangerous"" - when the Cadillac Escalade was new, that gigantic ugly piece of car it wasn't allowed. Some 2 years later it was permitted. So - modern cars are too big anyway. There is no stopping this."
"If the cyber truck is iconic, then so was the Pontiac Aztec. I haven‚Äôt seen one in person yet, but I own a stainless steel fridge and know how hard it is to keep clean. 

Never in a million years."
"The most amazing vehicle ever built. Hands-down. Once again, Tesla is light years ahead of the rest of the world. Their innovation."
watching your video is great. Only problem I have now is . I keep on sticking my tongue out compulsivelyüòÖ
25:37 hey dude you might want to change out this clip as its showing a womans chest through transparent clothes
I mean the fact that it won't be sold in the EU due to lack of safety standards tells you everything...
Great video!
"haha I wonder how Elon got the feedback about the gap and amout of trucks affected, If it is true that is impressive from QA side and from his side that he actually gave a think about it."
"Why does this feel like your best mastered video? All over, the online and audio sound and look great. Did you go to a post house?"
"modern cars are so god damn ugly- bloated sucked down gigantic bricks of ugly plastic with no definition or personality whatsoever. It's just like people decided ""hey, make this car big"" and people will buy it because ""hey this car is big"" so the cycle repeats endlessly. Cars just look like you fused 5 different cars together. What about those gigantic unnecessary skirts?"
I see a back to the future reboot using this as the time machine.
the most dangerous thing about the cybertruck is its crash sturcture imo other than that i think its iconic for the moment
"The last thing we need on the roads, is more huge fucking trucks. They make city streets unsafe,  and they take up too much space. Can understand trucks being used for commercial purposes, but if you are using one as a daily driver, especially one that is not good for commercial use, then you are what we call ""a bit of a wanker"""
"Man, this sort of glowing review really underlines your blindspots as a journalist. This car is a nightmare in every possible way - build quality, functionality, pedestrian safety, and overall value. This is going to age like milk - the truck, and this review."
This is basically a DMC Delorean retouch
maybe a strange comment - but very well written review!
I wasn't ready for a Fast and Furious teaser without Dom.... üöò
Already looking obsolete.
"NAILED IT;?D!!! The minute I saw that issue with the door gap I KNEW it had to be the door latch and likely just loose bolts, and I knew this because it happened with a pickup I owned 20 years ago ;?)"
"So we have a tech guy who makes a living by review tech telling us this ""Cyber Truck"" is ICONIC and whatnot...?"
I wonder why a pedestrian who would be utterly destroyed be a truck would be opposed to it whereas a bunch of people in a vehicle would show their support for it
"I really don't get why people hate on it, I really dig the style. I mean, common, how often in the last 15 years or whatever have cars and crossovers gone after the stubby rounded back in for the sake of aerodynamics? Porsche, Nissan GTR, a good number of crossovers and whatnot. It looks like someone left a shit in a wind tunnel and it formed the most aerodynamic shape. I want cars to be unique and absurd again. Like hyundai's hydrogen 74 car or whatever. I don't give a damn about air resistance, make cars unique and individualistic again! Honestly that is what I think is teslas strongest asset; their cars *look* different than the rest. Its the Keltec of cars lol"
it's not the first car that has steer by wire
"I will never buy it. but it is intressting to watch it. :-) 
But wait. U  payd for so much add ons (self driving, light bar, aerocaps....) but it is wothy? Whats the diffrent to Fisker Ocean?
//edit Okay, the fisker does not not working, it works wrong. ^^"
Moral of the story: Get a car With ICE and manual gearbox before it goes extinct üòÇ
"Ahh yes, more Cybertruk click bait. Just what the doctor ordered."
While Driving the front of the car looks like Pumbaa üêó
"You won't be fine if you get hit as the car is too rigid to be actually safe in an accident. On top of that, it also puts in more danger smaller vehicles, not to mention pedestrians or cyclists."
The cybertruck is iconic in the same way as Margaret Thatcher
Lol... What was that drag Race? Tesla compared it to a carrera S not a Turbo S
"Dude, I really get why you're the best at this. Fantastic presentation. üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ"
4:21 just imagine the wheel getting disconnected like the ps5 controller
"I feel like this will be an iconic vehicle for all the wrong reasons - quality of fit in the first models, reliability of initial models, potential danger to other road users, and unfortunately - and I put Marques in this bracket - the sycophantic behavior to hype this truck in a time when the owner of the business is acting in such an unhinged way."
The back is ugly AF which is too bad because the front is cool looking. Also honestly the more I look at it from the side the more it looks like it's some how driving backwards ü§£
Rest assured it's going to maim a lot of people....
".. as stupid car as ppl who need to ""wear it"" .."
Cool Video thanks. And cool german shirt :-). Greetings from Germany
"As always an incredibly great review, much better than the self-denying fanboys of haters did on many other channels"
The best car so far
Honestly. People buy a tesla for attention. And I think this fullfills that
20:31 can someone fact check that?
Enjoyed this video way more than your first Cybertruck review!! Can't wait to get mine in 5 years!
"No, the Cybertruck is not 'iconic' and will never BE 'iconic' - it's just a gimmick. People will no be talking about it or care about it in a year or so."
this whole review kindda feels like a humblebrag
Glorified SUV? SUVs are just glorified Minivans... so Glorified¬≤ Minivan=cybertruck... I like the look though...
"Never doubt the disconnect between society and an internet bubble.

All the videos that have come out on this vehicle, I keep needing to look at it as if my father was shopping for a truck... because the rest of us would get a smaller vehicle. An interesting one to me is my father's Ram 1500 had an issue where the steering column ""wasn't plugged in fully"" and when it became unplugged (which happened multiple times and one was with a Ram mechanic in the vehicle) the whole truck shut down and he couldn't steer it. He's not wimpy and both of us have dealt with ""heavy truck with no power steering"" and the steering didn't lock up, the steering wheel moved... but the wheels did not. It was described to us as being steering by wire, but I see no sign of that on the internet. So either Ram lied to my father or the Cybertruck isn't actually the first drive by wire vehicle (and I'm not saying the Ram is either). That's my only monologue on the topic.

Everything else mentioned is on point."
the battery can fry you in 0-60  seconds in case of car crash
"I really didn't enjoy this review. It seemed indecisive. 16 min in, and it feels like you didn't want to make this video yourself."
Awesome vid as always!
Important question: why is Marques wearing a German ultimate shirt?
THIS IS THE CROCS OF THE AUTO WORLD.
Visibile scratch at 9mm
literally looks like a 2nd graders drawing of a car
That transition into the Title card was EPIC!!!!!!!
"Regarding the PT Cruiser. I was in college during this time, and 100% YES‚Ä¶PT Crusiers got all the attention on the road when they first came out. People would slow down on the freeway and take a photo if their phone had a camera at the time, I remember following one just in awe. I know it‚Äôs hardto imagine, but I live through it‚Ä¶ these PT cruisers were getting so much attention. Just like the cyber truck is today."
"Hey, a VW Beetle is iconic, and it's definitely not rare. Whether it remains iconic will mostly be about how it develops its reputation, and whether it will ever leave North America, when it comes to being iconic worldwide. Otherwise, it'll just be an oddity in car history."
have you seen german mechanics analyzing the tesla car? hilarious!! Germans are THE car nerds!
"I respect you hugely Marquess, but I dont really enjoy watching Tesla videos not adressing the issues with Musk, his antics and the many problems with Tesla, their autopilot bs and so on."
"Iconic? idk, that word is usually used in a ""good"" connotation, but I guess you can be an ""icon"" of ""what not to do"" too. I don't have words to describe how just massively stupid and pointless I think this stupid vehicle is. At best it gives me something else to laugh at rich people for"
ÁæéÂõΩ‰∫∫ÁúüÂπ∏Á¶èÂïä
"Cybertruck,  Iconic or not.. If it is going to run into the same problems as the other Tesla cars has had with battery problems, Finding charging stations in more then major towns and being charged alot more money to charge it then buying gas then what is the point of buying one.  smh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ"
"All things considered, Cybertruck is actually a cheap car. If it were any other brand, it would've been a 500k car"
"16:00 Non-americans don't undestand anything in this table. So yes, the Cybertruck is slow in km/h after a few meters."
"‚ÄúYou will be fine‚Äù‚Ä¶. Typical American way of thinking. If you even consider not killing the neighbors daughter with your tank you are considers a communist‚Ä¶
Most EU cars have low hoods and dampers for collisions. That protects both sides!"
marques sir plz can i have a phone
1:13 Jeez.... that was a wicked intro üôå
"Good vid√©o,  nice looking truck.  üëç"
Should have known that drag race was bs üòÇ
"I know this is about tech, but MKBHD's ""ability"" to just ignore and overlook everything that Elon Musk is and who he is as a person is astonishing, really.

Like, I get it - you're not co-signing Elon's politics and views by buying a Tesla, but also at the same time - praising his products on a high traffic platform like this so much makes you wonder about MKBHD's stance on a lot of big social issues today."
"6:39 
It's not bulletproof.
It's been demonstrated"
"It looks different for the sake of looking different and that's it about its looks.
I don't understand why people hype up this wedge on four wheels"
I strongly believe Elon Musk designed it for Mars ü§£.
"Tesla = Death of American Tinkering. 
In the Automotive sphere, Classic cars, the Mustang, the F-150, the Wrangler were icons that embodied the American desire to Tinker. This Tinkering facilitated (1) purchase of tools (2) valuing a ""technician"" culture of repair and (3) bank rolled small scale Manufacturing of aftermarket parts. This Tinkering kept the American people free. If Ford went belly up in 1990. We had enough parts manufacturing, tools and know how, at the suburb level, to keep the trucks on the road going indefinitely. 

Tesla has killed this, and other manufacturers are following. We are no longer free. Our relationship with Manufacturers is now strictly a Master Slave Relationship. The Slave is only allowed to have, that which the master believes, a slave should need."
"MKBHD confirmed, Tesla Cybertruck is the new PT Cruiser."
"If you are considering the cybertruck, please look at the rivian r1t. It‚Äôs a great electric truck with just as many features"
As the saying goes - there is no such thing as bad publicity.
"OnePlus Nord CE 4 k1lled the Nothing Phone 2a?
Pls Check it out marques"
"I personally don't find the reverse camera display a problem. It's not new, the Toyota tundra has been doing it for a while, and i prefer the larger screen to the mirror"
"It‚Äôs kind of funny that you actually own a car that started out as weird and iconic, and then became mass produced. That‚Äôs exactly the arc of the portion 911."
You‚Äôre the best bro. You do very insightful and detailed talk about the products.
"12:25  Absolutely true but that's also Tesla's fault. When you make all kinds of bold or even outlandish claims to sell a product, don't be surprised your customers will go full stupid-mode when they buy it üòÑ 
15:28  And thank you for that. Explaining why quick is not the same as fast can be hard sometimes, especially to non-car people"
What about the safety features? ü§î
"The VW Beetle is iconic, becoming common doesn't change that."
"Wanna not overuse the phrase ""iconic"" bro , I hate it with passion. In fact I just vomited in my mouth by writing this bit ü§¢."
stockholm syndrome kicks in after about a month

Happy To See you !!! love you forever  ‚ù§‚ù§üôè Bests Car ‚ù§
You and your team are so damn good at making these videos.
consooooomm product....
"I saw one for the first time last week (oddly enough, at a Supercharger!), and there were a few people gathered around it, but not so many that I couldn't get a good look at it. I will say, it really does look like a movie prop and/or fake. Like, how can this be real? That said, I think it looks pretty cool. Not everyone's cup of tea, and I get that. But, so different from anything other than maybe a Delorian or some crazy 80's futuristic concept car."
"I must say, this video felt more like a documentary than a review. The cinematic quality, the shots switching back and forth so seamlessly, the way Marques speaks; everything. This is easily one of the best and highest quality videos I have ever seen, seriously. Mad respect to Marques and the rest of his gang for the good work, videos like this are why I love his channels so much."
"Saw my first Cybertruck today in Vegas, it definitely had that ""Wet stanless steel look"" when its dirty"
"It's not iconic, it's ironic.  It is dangerous, it's a stupid design, it's heavy, heavy, heavy.  Not sustainable and certainly not environmentally friendly.  It's as though Elon Musk became a truck."
What a video üôåüèªüôåüèª
"As always, insightful and entertaining review. Thanks Marques!"
The next PT Cruiser ü§£
"I can't believe they still won't give you a f*cking speedometer (or HUD) on a $100k+ vehicle, and no smart mirror? No 360 view? Seriously?"
"MKBDH- good graphics details!! Good team work!!
I love the looks, eagerly waiting to launch in India!! 

It's a combination of innovative tech and risk taking attitude which attracts me a lot!!"
"Portland, JAMAICA in the Building!!!  üáØüá≤üáØüá≤üáØüá≤üáØüá≤üáØüá≤üáØüá≤"
"The presenter is confusing the word iconic with notorious.

Throughout the video he very effectively defines the vehicle as notorious."
"I was given the first of the new VW Beetles when I was in Los Angeles decades ago. It was a blast to drive as it got a lot of attention. A trip of 30 minutes would take double because of getting ""boxed in"" on the freeways by camera happy drivers, people stopping you to ask about it...."
I see a cyber truck every day I saw 4 yester day their every where already
It is just fun when companies take risks like this
"""...1st ones to make steer-by-wire safe""

What makes you think it's safe?  Like FSD is ""safe""?  Like FSD is even ""FSD""?  Earth to Marques:  Elon lies."
"stop sucking up to Elon for another interview - that is lame . Face it , Cyber-T is a lemon ."
Marques jumps the shark.
Imagine a variable speed-based steering ratio that's purely mechanical (I imagine a simpler form of a CVT transmission on the steering column).
"it is iconic, the same way memes of stupid Sh** it iconic lol"
"I used to think that this thing looks stupid, but I recently saw one in person for the first time, and I have to admit; it looks pretty sick"
0:27 The sexiest truck ever made such a head turner and Tesla is Alien .üòÖ
That intro!!!
It's another look at me vehicle.
Would the model X be consider as iconic?
Great video
Iconic - in how dumb it looks. People are taking pictures of it because who knows if anybody will ever make a car that looks so stupid and awful ever again?
"The cyber truck is a snapshot of what is wrong with Murika these days, and the childish state of Musk's mind."
"I guess that this is a consequence for owning such an unusual piece of automotive propulsion.  Its like the time I dyed my hair orange for Halloween -- I got a lot of laughs at first but after a day or two, the orange color did get a bit old. Then reality sets in, and I ask myself, ""Was it worth it? Was it worth making a fool of myself, for being different?"""
"I know I am ""old"" and most certainly uncool....
But... If you are one of those people in the intro, the kind that would take the phone out and record it...
why? 
What is the point?
As I said, I am uncool, so I am not rotting my brain away on social media - but are you actually posting it there? Are you actually showing it to your friends? Are you ever going to go in and reminisce over that day you saw a cybertruck? 
I know I am being a bit provocative in the way I ask, but I really want to understand!"
"The PT cruiser ain't iconic, just because a car was made in big numbers doesnt mean its iconic or a weird style or such.

NO ONE thinks about the PT cruiser except fans of the car, same thing with the cybertruck, no one except fanboys will know and care in a few years.

Now...when EVERYONE knows what a cybertruck is then it will be iconic (example: everyone knows the back to the future car, its iconic in media/entertainment and in the car world because of the body, the cybertruck didn't really do anything different exteriorwise except look like ass)"
This video is glaringly irresponsible. He rightly brings up the buggy Fisker software that people ‚Äúpaid‚Äù for but briefly points out the completely missing autopilot feature (and FSD) for those who paid for it. He‚Äôs reviewing what the truck could be in the future at that point. Do better please
Thank you for pointing out how inefficient the cyber truck is. Very few people can actually do it. Tesla's approach for the cybertruck is literally clout. They want so many people to just look at it that they don't have to make it good. They want everyone to see that it's towing a 911. not that the quarter mile isn't really a full quarter mile.
Was the Aztek iconic? Or just ugly
The cross guard not doing his job and recording you is kind of insane lol
Who thaught he was going to pull out an AR instead of a sledgehammer?
Where's the Xiaomi Su7 review? Or you just want to promote Tesla
The rear view mirror not being the camera is ridiculous
"For me, the cybetruck is a shiny trashcan
Its shiny and gets your attention but thats it"
BUTTONS.... Blackberry versus iPhone...
Spot on with what Foundation means.
"911 Turbo,...Tesla Vid was just 911"
for hauling a van beats this on every front.
14:02 HELLL YESSSSSSSS
"The steering looks overrated to me. It 'sounds' nice, but having the steering controlled by sensors just means that if a sensor fails - and inevitably it will fail if Boeing's shenanigans have said anything lately - you lose steering.

Mechanical parts can fail too, but electronic parts are more prone to failure long-term, and are more expensive to re-manufacture. Huge L."
I am astonished by how many quality issues and overhyped capabilities were ignored in this video.
"Really liked this video. I'd love to see more videos like this - opinions, unique observations, good presentation. Good job, MKBHD team."
Sorry it's not iconic
"Porsche 911, VW Beetle"
Nice unobtanium Avatar reference!
"I don't believe this is independant journalismn anymore, when Fisker gets killed for bugs in car (in a test that is 2 versions behind the latest update...) and Tesla gets away with releasing a car without FSD and the door falling off...  Makes me sad."
When I saw the intro : üòÆ
It‚Äôs fun to look back in design history and study things that where touted as being the ‚Äòfuture‚Äô. None of those things aged well.
Awesome vehicle
"I love ugly cars, but, this doesn't seem to be worth it (I can't even buy it if I wanted to)."
Iconic?...more notorious...like a Pontiac Aztec. I've seen several in the wild now and they are ugly.
I'm calling it right now... the cybertruck will be the new Pontiac Aztec 10 years from now
Another incredible video!
"So its a technology demonstrator, masquerading as a SUV, that is masquerading as a pickup truck?"
"There are examples of mass-produced, iconic cars. The original VW Beetle. The Willy's Jeep. Both had shapes that were distinctive and unique enough that the manufacturers kept the through line into future generations."
Something that ugly doesn't deserve to be iconic. The only reason it's even popular at all is the Tesla/Musk cult. Any other company makes a car this stupid and it would get lambasted by the whole world.
"Fast & furious loves a 10-second quarter mile car‚Ä¶.. now I‚Äôm expecting a cybertruck in the next F&F prolly towing a space shuttle or cargoshipü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Only problem they‚Äôd have would be installing a 36-gear shifter for the drag race scene on a 30km airstripüòÇ"
You can get it wrapped???
You released this video a couple days early
"I ahve not seen one yet.
But I do stare at lamborghini rv!!!

It is beginning to look normally!"
"I saw one the other day chilling in Woodstock, NY. The town is full of Subarus and Volvos, so to see this space machine in that context was so shocking. It was the first time a new car was able to catch my attention. All new cars look the same, but kudos to Tesla for building a truly unique thing"
You‚Äôre a Goat for exposing the Porsche ad üá©üá™
"THAT TRUCK ICONIC ????????
HAVE U EVER DRIVE ......UNIMOG......???????"
Yes it is.
Great review
"It turns heads because of the novelty. A turd on wheels would have the exact same effect. I predict that in 3 years, every single owner will be ashamed of driving this around."
pointless to get an electric car if it's all backed up by fossil fuels.
I think it looks cool and futuristic!
"Okay, we get it. You want to be cool and join the tesla-hating crowd"
Most comments say it is the coolest truck.
"Whether or not this truck will succeed on the market depends on the global economy, the demand, the appeal, and its price. The truck may fail, but will become a classic instantly regardless. This is going to be up there in terms of legendary status like the Lamborghini Countach, Ferrari F40, Nissan Skyline Coupe GTR, Toyota Supra, Ford GT, among other modern classics."
Ayyyy my boy MILES YESSIRR
"The obsessive ""minimalism"" (i.e. cost cutting) is my biggest pet peeve with Tesla (as well as the other manufacturers copying their approach).  Rear visibility on the Cybertruck is so bad...it's safety/ergonomic negligence that they don't put a screen for the back up camera in the mirror.  Also, just add a heads-up display on the Model 3/Y/and Cybertruck if you refuse to add a gauge cluster screen like most every other car above $40,000 or so..."
"Great video, but I do feel like you skirted around the fact that this is a deathtrap for anyone outside the car... like I see you trying the subtle mentions, but who cares about fly by wire when it's hitting a cyclist with bulletproof steel?"
Th√© most ridiculous vehicle ever designed‚Ä¶. Right up there with the reliant Robin for a vehicle we will laugh at for decades.
"I finally saw one of these in real life, and I couldn't stop myself from laughing."
definitely a low point in our society when people were on a wait list for the PT cruiser hahaha
This thing is uglier then established country musics Response to cowboy carter. The only reason I can find to buy one is to get a low Production number and keep the mileage low. Good examples will Likely be worth a small fortune in some time.
"That last bit about seeing more of them changing the novelty of them is 100% true.  We got one of the very first Ioniq 5s to land in our area, and for almost a year, it was exactly how you described.  You couldn't go anywhere without someone lowering their windows to take photos, or having people run over to talk about it when you park, or having people at stoplights yelling out questions or comments from their cars or the sidewalk.  But now it has been two years and that's died down quite a bit as more have arrived.  That is exactly how these will be treated.  The other x-factor will be how the first drivers of these things will actually behave on the road, because if the first couple hundred of them drive like idiots, the ""cool"" factor will die pretty quick."
"@MKHB you‚Äôre using yaw incorrectly.  The front end lifts during acceleration or dives during braking, the vehicle is yawwing when turning the front end left or right, and roll is the left or right side being higher than the other during a yaw event."
"My biggest fear/thought about the CT is knowing eventually a LOT of people are going to be driving around a 3.5 ton metal brick, there's going to be more and more accidents involving said heavy brick. It's not going to be pretty.
And before people chime in that there are heavier EV trucks, none are made out of such solid materials that don't perform well in an accident."
Okay my guy. What did they pay you?
lol dude's simping for Elon.
please give your editing team a raise! very talented !!
Ugliest vehicle ever. Looks like a child's drawing. The interior is sparse and so badly designed. Just another rip-off.
Quick summary : it's a waste of money
This is annoying.
"On the topic of a steer-by-wire system, my 2015 Infiniti Q50 has this. If the steer-by-wire fails, it has a mechanical mechanism in place that will engage and turn it into a traditional steering vehicle. From what I know of Tesla, I really doubt the Cybertruck has any true backup system if the steer-by-wire fails. 
I googled this and all I see in the Cybertruck are electrical redundancies, no actual mechanical steering..."
great videi üëèüèªüî•
"Even tho the design and engineering of the cybertruck is iconic, do not be coaxed in tothinking that cybertruck is the first to come up with steer by wire systemin a production car. To clear the delusion steer by wire has been an option in Nissan infinity models since 2013, But then again its not the first time Marques has been wrong about Nissan."
"11:10 those are NOT the same tires you can buy with the same name or that come on the trucks you mentioned.  These are a special Cybertruck-specific Goodyear tire that has the tread shaved down. Also the car's offroad or even messy/snowy weather performance is further compromised because the current software only allows for the diffs to be open.


Also, lol @ the offroad mode bc can't you be denied warranty for taking your CT offroad?"
(Me looking at the other cars plates and seeing he lives in New Jersey
"Thanks, for video.."
"I remember the first time I saw a Model 3 in Seattle, it felt iconic then. After years of mass production it's no more special seeing one than a toyota."
Hummmm the door bolt ‚ö° guy... They got him from Boeing.
The Cybertruck is iconic in the wrong ways.
Intro is sick ‚ù§
"I found the last few minutes of this video particularly interesting. Brand evolution......The PT Cruiser by Chrysler versus the Cyber Truck by Tesla........there is the difference. The expectations from consumers going forward of Tesla will be ""hey this is a company that is associated with a brand that is going to send humans to Mars"" - therefore the evolution of the product/s will be similar to what we saw and expected from Apple from the Ipod to the latest IPhone. Compared to Chrysler...........The Ma and Pa car company."
Uttered Countach and Veyron in the same sentence as this monstrosity‚Ä¶ love you Marques but stick to smartphones lmao
Great review!
BROOOOOO That intro is so cool!
intro is sick
"Let's say I buy an EV right now. What does that change?? I am still going to produce CO2 with fast fashion, eating meat and etc.... Car production is a ton (literally) of CO2. What a delusion."
"I would never buy a car where the steer wheel is disconnected from the wheels. Reason: as an amateur radio, I know that zero electronics are RFI (radio frequency interference) proof. If the electronics are interfered somewhere, it will be a life threatening car not only for the driver but especially for all other people in traffic."
The AMC Pacer is also iconic.
To me the cybertruck is what the apple airpods were when they first came out
love that intro!
"The performance section, all I wanted was for you guys to do a single corner. Any corner. That would have been funny."
"Oh trust me, the PT Cruiser was just as cool when first came out as it is now."
"Tesla try be tricky, lul."
"Steer by wire in concept doesn't scare me, the fact that it's Tesla that implemented it scares the fuck out of me. With their history I do not trust them at all to have actually made it as reliable as it needs to be."
Stear by vire already have in BMw F series nothing new
Already Disaster. Already recalled.
"No EVs are not quick. Good EVs with good performance can be quick. A Chevy EV for example, is not quick. A Mercedes EV is not quick, for example"
"There‚Äôs a 0% Chance Elon wasn‚Äôt lying when he said that only around 15 cybertrucks had that issue. Seems like an oddly specific, oddly low number for a mass produced car from a car company known for panel gaps and quality control issues"
ioniq 5N bro

Car Life Scouring Multi Purpose cleaner is probably the best cleaner for these Cybertruck. I saw someone demoing it at a car show and it's pretty impressive.
Best videos bro. Keep up the good work. üí™üèæ
‚ÄùTesla didnt have to do that‚Äù what do u mean by that? Ofc they did to be able to sell this? If they dont wanna be the F150 they gotta do everything diffrently
"Well done video, so thanks for making it.¬†

Regarding iconic automotive designs which became mass produced, the 1966 Ford Mustang comes to mind. And for sure the 1939 VW Beetle. I‚Äôm sure there are others too. If 30% - 40% of those reservations become actual sales, then I agree,  Cybertruck deserves to be in the same league."
"This Review is on a complete different level, even by standards of this channel, big kudos to Marques and the team üôå Personally, I feel that the Cybertruck is ONLY about the design. Steer-by-wire, 800V architecture or clever air-suspension aren‚Äôt this car‚Äôs selling point(s). The design, on the other hand, is. So, even though this car definitely received everyone‚Äôs attention within the tech/ car enthusiasts community, it will most likely end up being bought by people who want it for its design only and don‚Äôt care about the ‚Äútruck-stuff‚Äù, let alone the technical specs of it. And I guess that‚Äôs perfectly legit."
still i like my gmc denali over this car
"Seeing Marques make excuses for the Cybertruck and ignore all the other issues and complaints that have been coming up is just sad. Unfortunately expected, but sad. Basically just a hype man for Elon at this point."
They pose a significant threat to basically any other car on the road because of the steel frame and mass. It'll go right through a ford explorer.
This truck looks like it came straight out of a ps1 game.
As iconic as the VW Beetle. The first one. The one designed in 1939.
"I'm gonna disagree that being Iconic means ""rare,"" just look at any books of ""the most iconic products,"" and you see mass-produced products, pretty much only mass-produced products."
"boy, the tesla fanboy inside marques was really hard at work for this video. how can you list so many flaws (and knowingly miss so many of more flaws) and still say it is a good car üôÉ"
This was such a lovely video and review. The hard work you put into it shows
"its not iconic, the Delorien is iconic"
"Steer by wire is really exciting but almost everything else about the cyber truck is dumb.

They should've released a much more conventional truck and gotten it out 2-3 years ago, but on some level it's just a marketing stunt and in that respect in guess it worked?"
As a cyclist who's been bumped several times by drivers in city traffic it definitely looks scary.
Still not buying one...i'll get the ioniq 6
"the ""no its not stock"" flex"
"my dream vehicle for now, the CyberTruck"
there is a research about the aerodynamic of trucks and fuel consumption. i wonder how the cybertruck performs?
"7:31 Just because the car will be intact doesn't necesarilly mean you will be fine. If the car transfers energy from the crash to the squishy marshmallow behind the wheel instead of dampening it with crumple zones, you won't be fine."
It's ugly.
"super interesting video, but I really wish you would have gone deeper on the ""you'll be fine in an accident thing."" so much of the hate the cybertruck gets is because it's a death trap for everyone else. the same design that makes it interesting an unique makes it dangerous for everyone else on the road. getting a thumbs down from the cyclist is because that person doesn't feel safe around that vehicle (and for good reason). I don't care if people drive interesting and weird cars, but putting other people at risk sucks."
"You just explained quick vs fast and 0-60 vs quarter mile time & et better than most ""car youtubers"" understand it."
"*Bolts came loose* youtuber solution: tape and ""schedule a service""
every truck guys solution: tighten the goddamn bolts"
What I love about the cyber truck is that its embodiment of the idea 'think different'.
I think getting a thumbs up (or thumbs down) in real life is underrated.
the cyber is one of the most interesting cars ive seen. its looks horrible on pictures. dont look at picture hahah. but it is beautiful in person. im not sure why that is
The sound recording was great.
Is it just or all the b rolls of cybertruck felt like ai genrated
The Cybertruck is the AMC Pacer of 2024.
You should probably start talking about Toyota successfully developing a gearbox for electric cars so Elon Musk gets to know about it through one of your videos out of his political timepass on ùïè
- Are you telling me you built a time machine... out of a cybertruck?
I‚Äôm not sure if they were pleasantly surprised by seeing a Cybertruck or by the fact that Marquues was driving it!!
No.
PT Cruiser was never cool or iconic
I wouldnt want people to drag race  on the street with that tank.
"Nobody:
Marcus: ‚ÄúDoes this come in matte black?‚Äù"
"I am getting rust vibes, I don't know why..."
"It doesn't have to be rare to become an iconic design in a good way. Look at the VW Beetle or the VW Bus. Or the old Citroen DS from the 50s and 60s. Or the Mini. All of these were mass produced and no one can say there aren't still iconic and beautiful. I personally find the Cybertruck ugly but it is undeniably iconic. I think it tends to age well for those who find in pretty today, but only time will tell."
OK... Marques is Cinema...
"The biker probably gave a thumbs down because they know that if they are hit by any vehicle, the cybertruck is most likely to kill them"
the most subtle transition scene - truck stuff 10:03
I've always respected people with unusual tastes - in everything ... until maybe now. o_O
Good luck with the rust covering this car the moment any water touches it.
"Yeah, I laughed the first time I saw one. The second time some wrapped one, it was still ugly but looked better. Lmao"
"'They have to get ""clever""' as a sentence is extra interesting, because in Dutch/German the word for clever developed along two lines, in one language it still means clever, in the other it means you were bad (I think in like a deceitful way). Marques using the word clever in a similar negative way shows exactly like the meaning of a word can change."
kuradi Werbung
I just want them to be affordable (like Tesla promised) so I can buy one.
yup. I remember seeing a PT Cruiser and thinking how cool and unique it was. Thinking I'd get one some day... thank goodness that day never came. Now I see it and just wondering what was I on!! uuughck. A PT Cruiser?? eeesh!
so its a small truck like the ford explorer sport trac kinda cool also if its steel is it even safe to crash like crumple points also tesla finna get your insurance hiked for driving fast
"Wow what a production, felt like a cybertruck movie, visual effects sound effects this is god level production"
Sick intro
It's cool AF
Did you said he is your child? Aren't you in your mid 30s? This young man looked like a adult?
Hmmü§î looks like Elon took some styling cues from Lamborghini when I look at it from certain angles.
"Cybertruck is for the nerd gamers from moms basement like Marques here, who won't actually do any blue collar work no need an actual truck, because then he'd find out that it actually sucks as a truck, and is beatn by even a barebones F-150. Not mentioning the rusting issues, which other creators mentioned a lot but I don't see a single word of it in here. Go figure."
What's the ct1 that showed for 1sec and you tried to hide it
That windshield is asking to be broken. I do not like any electric vehicle. If it isn't broke don't fix it. If I am going to get a truck it's a Tundra or Tacoma
"Marcus, getting defensive about gas powered cars makes me respect him more üíØüíØ"
"I know this is not Tesla's fault specifically, but american truck culture that makes people truck despite not needing them is, itself, a big issue, and Tesla is capitalizing on it"
Iconic? HELL NO.
We need to stop building cars that are too big. This is a middle finger to the earth. That it is electric does not make it any better
For fingerprints on stainless steel... Pledge.
"""My child"" I mean my car üòÇ‚ù§üî•"
This is the most expensive disaster of a vehicle I've ever seen in my life and it is glorious to see people waste life savings and going into debt for it. True renegades.
You should do a collaboration video on car reviews with @Doug Demuro
I think Marques is the best storyteller YouTuber. Hot take?üòÇ
"people we're just not ready for it, and people on the internet always put their negative food forward if they don't have anything nice to say or if they're jealous."
It's a vehicle for the most devout cult members.
"*hello*
-hello-
_hello_"
"Dat truck is ugly AF. unless you get it wrapped the rusty patina is gonna look trash in no time as well. gotta give it to them, they know their customer. people who like it, adore it. also, ""minimalist"" just means boring."
"""And so, I've expanded it here."" The way you said that line with the hand motion and the slight smirk, had me cracking up üòÑ."

Give us a rust review.
I saw one yesterday and I couldn't stop laughing
11:28 nobody‚Äôs buying an f-150/silverado 1500/ram 1500 if they‚Äôre towing on a regular basis. that survey is a bad representation of the towing market.
What about review mi su7?
I got to ride in the first Tesla in Missouri and this is so true. Kinda funny at first but definitely got scary fast.
I don't know what's iconic about a car that looks like a junkyard build üòÇ
I cringed when he said ‚ÄúAs a product person‚Äù
"usually what i hate most about teslas arent the cars themselevs, it's the drivers and how cocky and dangerous they are on highways. i've seen 1 or 2 cybertrucks in my small hometown, and from what i could tell they were just driving normally. i cant complain. but oh man have i been cut off by 90% of the tesla X, Y or S or whatver. yall, dont be a dumbass on the road, we're all literally jus tryna drive here"
you're a great reviewer and calming not hyper with loud background music or sarcastic stuff - appreciate that
"The dragracing stuff, how is it with the battery? How much do you use per run? How long do you have to wait before the next one to prevent overheating, (if you even have to)? In the case you do fast accelerations on the street, do you notice that the battery goes down much faster or not?"
"I really hope this style of car building will never really catch on. Let's be honest it looks aweful. It is iconic due to it being so apparently ugly and so it stands out. 

In my eyes the attraction of road users isn't it's most dangerous part. Obviously the suv type cars are all more dangerous than regular road vehicles. 

It sits too high, gives false illusions of control. Weighs too much. What will happen if it rolls? Do the sharp pointy edges of the car hold up? Or do they simply crush under the weight of the entire battery and suspension system? And to get inside the car quickly in the event of an emergency, you have to wait an extra second to get into the car as it has no physical handles... A handle will always be faster. Nice having a bullet proof car. But when you are getting shot at, that extra second to get into the bulletproof, metal thing, will add up... 

It is a mixed bag. The designers put totally random american stereotypes on the table and said 'let's do it all in one car'. 

Then the manipulative and failure of marketing it in any factual or practical way hits the final nail in the coffin. See it as a delorean. Except the cybertruck doesn't have any real character. At least the delorean looked sharp, and was put together with lots of passion. They simply neede way more money. 

The cybertruck designers had all the money they wanted. Tesla doesn't need to target their audience. Their audience targets them. And then they come with such mixed piece of metal angled, so called 'simplicity' or 'minimalism'. Yet not having a problem with making their services overly complex. Hooking you up with all the usual tesla subscriptions to keep your seats heated. In a matter of speaking... 

Tesla has never really gotten close to the other older, minimalistic cars out there. I haven't seen a Tesla with soul or character. It's all hightech and standing out. That is in no way at all what makes a ferrari or mclaren the beauties they are. It's a hype. Nothing more. And in 30 years we will look back at it and maybe see why it was modest. But nobody will ever understand why it had to be made in the first place. As it has no purpose at all.

That is what it's lacking. Without purpose you lose all forms of character."
"The outro is ""Flo"" by Molife"
"People often complain about no knobs and switches on Teslas.  Otoh, Teslas handle all kinds of verbal commands to do things buttons and switches would, like turning on the wipers or making the AC/heater less cold/warm, changing audio volume, etc.  Also has scroll wheels on the steering wheel to change audio volume or change fan speed if I don't want to use verbal commands. Of course most of that can, in most cases, also be controlled thru the touch screen or like on my Tesla via stalks.   Also the left scroll wheel allows changing the driver display on my MS to one of a few on the right or left side of the display. Just some examples.  Btw, every 4-5 weeks there is a free OTA software update that keeps making the car more functional and/or sometimes more fun/cool if it's only a cosmetic thing, so the Tesla gets better as time passes.  Does that happen to your car?"
It‚Äôs our modern day DeLorean
No talk of crumple zones huh?
Roll & Pitch :)
"A physical button is better, until you don't need it or need an extra one. You can't constantly update physical buttons or make them better, that's why they're worse.
Do you think phones should go back to keypads lol? Blackberry yo."
17:10 ‚Äûno it‚Äôs not stock‚Äú ü•∂
"Honestly, fast car is overrated because you‚Äôll never get to drive that fast on the road anyway. So quick make more sense"
Wheres the April Fools :(
"What about crumpling zones, overrated???"
ev scam
"DeLorean cars were also made of stainless steel, and they look way better than cybertruck"
Cybertruck will cost 4 times the original cost in Nepalüá≥üáµüôÉ
Is it... rusting ?
"It's just cool.
We need more cool stuff in the world."
"The only modern looking and innovatively designed car for 70 years.
Zero to One.
All other cars are just boring legacy auto."
The Porsche comparison is so tiring. The towing test was done against a BASE NON TURBO. Why is that so hard to understand?
"WHO SAID MONEY CAN'T BUY ANYTHING, FROM CARS TO OPINIONS  ""ITS LIKE BUYING AN EXPENSIVE BETA TEST VEHICLE"". THIS TRUCK WILL KILL PEOPLE AS MORE OF THEM HIT THE ROADS. And the driver will be always safe mostly, but imagine a Bike or two wheeler colliding with the Razorblade of a ""TRUCK""."
Awesome intro üî•üî•üî•
"I see where you are trying to go, but it's hard to compare the Cybertruck to the PT Cruiser as the PT Cruiser wasn't an innovative vehicle. It just had a unique look at the time. So I agree, only time will tell!"
"I think Adam Something defines this piece of trash much better. Love this channel, but to celebrate or say anything good about this car is almost offensive to other competent cars"
too much glazing
"Excellent video. Great production skill. Great informational review, and all around professional."
6:44 though marq was finna pull out a blicky
Just watched on of your first videos and then watched this one. It‚Äôs insane how far you‚Äôve come when it comes to quality.
"We will learn more when Munro analyses the 48V architecture but other tear downs are already happening and it appears some accessories are 12V in the Cybertruck. This is why Tesla sent to all OEMs for free the schematics so subcontractors can go 48V on all accessories. Smaller, stronger, lighter and fewer is the aim all will migrate to."
Dude this is the best review ever in the history of mankind‚Ä¶ I ‚ù§ you @mkbhd.
So funny how some people actually think that people who buy these types of trucks will think they're actually gonna tow with it.
Why do you keep sleeping on the Silverado EV?
"Towing is changing big time with battery/motor operated trailers. Not just for camping but for moving, working and sporting. I wonder how vehicle licencing authorities and Insurance companies will treat this new kind of trailer."
Definitely not iconic. Who even gets to decide this. I would say that Tesla in general might be.
"Yes, it is an icon. It will go down in history as a testament that people will buy anything for the sake of being 'different', 'quirky', or 'disruptive', even if the product looks like it escaped from the factory mid-production. We see this in fashion all the time as well. If you make it in limited quantities, you can also charge way more than the product is worth."
The blue hoodie is so clean. anyone got an ID?
Musk probably thought about zombie apocalypse when imagining it so no wonder it is a huge hazard for pedestrians
"13:15 no it's not fine using a massive truck just because ""it looks cool"". this culture of cars is damaging our environment.  what we should do is move away from using massive cars to move one person and instead have more public transport alternatives around the world"
BYD is coming 4 ya TESLA
steer by wire is the worst thing since the invention of power steering.
so Elon knows about the 15 trucks with defects and still shipped them?!
"""Everybody thinks it's ugly as fuck, but I've been staring at it for years and I can't tell anymore. Everybody also thinks it's super expensive. That's a good thing, right?"""

World class review
I bet the biker that gave the thumbs down was a Harley driver.
How on earth is it legal to produce and drive this pedestrian eater? IN what world is not having crumple zones not mandatory and desired?
I really hate the design of this cybertruck
"The cybertruck has an monoblade wiper that doesn't even extend leaving the passenger with an half cleaned windshield.
Now what I'd expect from a $80K truck."
damn this one was great.. look forword to redwood :D
It looks good
MRquis from showtime auto..
24:00 lotta car guys dont like electric cars. tesla especially. coming from JDM and/or drifting car community at least. thats probably where a lot of the üëé comes from
who tf is saying that it doesn't look nice?
"In the infiniti q50 ""steer by wire"" was made 10 years ago"
‚ÄúMy child‚Äù i mean my carü§£ü§£ü§£
I‚Äôll never trust an MKBHD review again.
Can we just shortly appreciate how good these videos are made?
all teslas overrated people buy cause of social status they think is cool like apple ..there are  way better electric cars and trucks out there
"Great video! It‚Äôs easy to criticise new concepts, something completely different. Of course it‚Äôll be polarising but what annoys me isn‚Äôt the design it‚Äôs the many people who will buy it and never use it as a truck! Get this isn‚Äôt a cybertuck only thing."
"Marques, could you talk a bit about battery degradation with those vehicles that constantly use Superchargers? You've got a model S for quite some time, must know a think or 2 about it already. THX!"
You are so disapointing Marques üò¢
IT is just new and shiney...
"Dude, usually love your channel, but this one clearly shows your asociation  with tesla"
This video was very well scripted. Thank you and the team for making so great content.
Pretty OK surface level review
Some people get distracted by the bullet proof bit. It's just a way to highlight that the truck has a rugged exterior - which is one of the two key selling points of pickups. It wasn't designed to be bullet proof - so let's talk about how rugged it is for real truck work and not get distracted.
"Iconic in every bad way imaginable, perhaps"
"Its the  ""Multipla"" of trucks"
"Damn. I said this on your podcast video. I've been selected to pick up my reservation but I don't want it anymore. I would have liked to just sell it, but that seems to be a big nono."
"""Good luck everyone else!"""
Replace all panels with carbon fiber.
its a good thing that people are finding shit very artistic
"Off Topic question... What aspect ratio are you using for the video? Because with my phone it fit perfectly 
(it's not too small and it's not taking all the screen... It's just right!) 
Thanks to anyone responding üôÉ"
"No, the most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is that it Will Cut Off Your Finger, or your child's fingers, if the the Frunk shuts on them. Obviously, these accidents are rare, but some people are loosing their fingers for sure! Also, EVERYTHING will stain the ""Stainless"" steel. Lots of soaps and chemicals, bird poop, and on and on.  And Elon Musk is an A$$-Clown."
Iconic for rusting
honestly thank god pt cruisers aren't everywhere. I haven't seen one in years lol
MKBHD Quality ‚ù§
The car is striking and also ugly... The biker was probably;y thinking about the lack of crumple zones
So 7/10 ???üöúüí®
where is your april 1st video?
Not by a long shot
I thought it was very good with towing ü§î

im wondering why you called fisker worst ev while cyberstuck exists. I'm gonna watch it just to know and I'm sure this one is the worst
do you employ script writers.........I think you should
The Cybertruck is iconically bad
"none of the footage made on the road seems reals, the car looks so different i can't wrap my mind around the fact it is an actual fully functional vehicle"
Countach????????  Please.  Maybe if you eat granola and hug trees.  This ‚Äútruck‚Äù looks like a clich√© dystopian movie prop.  People are so predictable when it comes to ‚Äúnew‚Äù things.  Eventually style and design take precedence over ‚Äúnew‚Äù.  C12 looks like the ‚ÄúDominator‚Äù from storm chasers.  I know they got a lot of attention too.
"We need to see how it handles the moose test, with that steer by wire system"
"I‚Äôve never wanted new tech as much as I want steer by wire. I think it will revolutionise performance cars, drifting will be a piece of cake. Want!"
Drag Race the Cyber Truck to Taycan Turbo S
Ayo where‚Äôs the April fools video?
"What happens when those steering sensors fail, I couldn't trust it."
"Let me tell you something, if you talk to a stranger who describes your vehicle looking 'crazy, like a movie prop, alien.' Im not sure you can count those as positive remarks, just polite way of not straight up calling your purchase ugly. Secondly, asking someone to guess how much the thing you bought cost while standing next to it is not really the best way to get a honest answer. They are simply overshooting their real guess to avoid offending you with lowball answers . Its just another case of 'oh its interesting'."
PRODUCTION VALUE+++++++++++++++
AI voice enhance on Marques is a bit distracting...
"You're probably a little young, but the VW Beetle or original Mini bridged this iconic to popular paradox with no detriment to their legacy."
"Bro, is it possible see an MKBHD PLAUD Note review?"
heh truck stuf
I just love this intro man
"Hi @MKHD you might probably not see this. However, I would love to see a video on your production process again. From backstage looks to you on camera."
yeah i think most people would have the same reaction if they saw a koenigsegg or a pagani where most 0people dive a scaped altima
Not me trying to scroll past every over used cybertruck design joke
The thumb showing Marques in the blindspot of a hulking steel knife on wheels is NOT iconic.
I just know they loved that B roll of the cybertruck between two semis
This thing has that predator vibe... Lions still have that revere even in their nimbers
"12:28 I love and hate listening to someone brag about how capable there 4x4 is. The less they know about off-roading the more capable they think their 4x4 is. 

I know a guy whos barely been off-roading but his truck he would brag could climb a pole. 

My other buddy when you ask him about his stock Rubicon Jeep. He says it's pretty capable but there's definitely limitations and it doesn't compare to his trailered rock crawler. In other words an expert will never brag they're capable of more than they can do"
"It's iconic to me too, but even without the rare factor :) Awesome video & Thanks :)"
9:07 as a mechanic I thought it was funny when I watched your last video. You complained about panel gaps lol. My door won't shut all the wayüò¢ dang panel gaps üòÖ
"A very good review. Thank you, Marques"
"4:47 I'm really excited about steer by wire. 
If the truck will not turn on and you're only option is to tow it with a tow rope how do you steer it?"
"Such a hideous model... I will stick to plug-in hybrid korean/Japanese models, much better in so many ways"
"im a biker and would absolutely give a thumbs up, I have the CT on reserve and for what its worth I have a motorcycle that is called the Beast, the super duke 1290, and my bike is one that has its detractors because of the futuristic sharp angle looks it has, but the look and stares and the amount of people that want me to rev the throttle on it says that people love the looks. im a painter and use my grand Cherokee for hauling my tools around, so I would definitely be a person that actually hauls things around and since I do track days on my bikes towing would be used well,"
"After watching so many cyber truck reviews, it was refreshing to get some new feeling content around this vehicle"
"i dont really care about the cybertruck... its not gonna be a vehicle i'll ever see in my country - nobody here uses a pickup truck, except landscaping companies.
and i really, really, really, really, really dont like elon musk. he's a moronic person and i dont think anyone should support him with their money"
90k$ and already rusting  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
"The worst reason for which you buy a car is to flex , don point this Marques pls.."
Nah.
"""Is it iconic?"" is a dumb way to frame a review. No one should buy it because it's dangerous, overpriced, and poorly made. For anyone interested, apparently a mixture of hydrogen peroxide with a small amount of vinegar and salt will help speed up the rusting process üëç"
"Hilarious that a bicyclist, a member of one of the most insufferable groups of people in the world imo, would openly express their dislike of this vehicle, while a group of normal people in a car loved it. Both could've rode right by without externalising their opinion of it, but one chose to express positivity and the other negativity. Pretty much sums it up. The closed minded and most obnoxious of society hate this vehicle, and the rest of us who don't have the time or inclination to hate an inatimate object because it's different (or because of who made it) seem to either love it or at least enjoy a fleeting moment of amusement at something new and creative. Online it's overwhelmingly snide comments and negativity, outside in the real world it's overwhelmingly people pulling out their cameras and fawning over it."
I would sincerely be delighted if Tesla made an aluminum (aluminium) version with softer edges (maybe a more aerodynamic profile) and available with the standard colors of their other vehicles. I would hope that a material change would also lower the cost of production tooling and provide a cost savings for those looking for an alternative EV truck.
I‚Äôm VERY surprised that safety wasn‚Äôt mentioned at all.
"I hate the way the cybertruck looks, and I don't particularly like tesla, but I'd say it's pretty iconic."
"A huge lemon. Despite its size if you're 6'2"" or more you gotta contort to get in the front, and you can't sit in the back. Massive pillars impede visibility,  Terrible viz out the rear.

Insurance nightmare for sure - imagine the cost of a new windscreen."
"And btw, all modern in production trucks 
Are not that beautiful ü§î
Just as a category of cars

So why not go with a car that dessided to strip out not only buttons around touchscreen but the design in general )

I also find it fascinating 
How car beenig electric is making manufacturers to think outside of the box (pun intended in case of that truck) 

But here we are, why make a car with a classic form dictated, more or less, buy engine under the hood
Whenits not there
And even stearing wheel isnt conected to wheelsü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just like we don't need to make a front grill on e-cars anymore, cos people got over it by now) we can go a bit more experimental with how the car should look overall"
"I bought a 2010 Kia Soul in May of 2009 and must have been one of the first in the Seattle area. For a good year and a half it was fun watching people do a double take while driving down the street.

Funny enough, that Soul was one of my favorite cars I‚Äôve owned. It took all the abuse I threw at it and much more."
"Day 3 of rewatching this video
And trying to understand whether I like the truck or not ü§î

Not sure that word ‚Äúlike‚Äù qualifies, but more - would go for it, just for fun

May be it just appeals to those of us, who used to draw cars as children and they all, at first, looked a bit like that"
I don't think screens instead of physical mirrors is legal in the US?
"We make street cars faster and faster, but give folks speeding tickets. Weird!"
"Your YouTube is destroy American EV industry. China EV industry are selling all over the world. One of Chinese EV company sold 120,000 in a day. Those EV vehicle have a full technology of Apple user and AI technology chips. Chinese don't need YouTube to explain why or what. American EV industry is going down because you are destroying all American EV industry. People's are not buying EV vehicle it's because of what you said in your YouTube."
"ppl crying being a beta tester for  car company. meanwhile ""Americans experience more than two million side effects from drugs every year, and more than 100,000 people are killed from properly prescribed medications."""
Will you ever speak to the fact that Tesla is dropping the ball and the car is unreliable as hell or will you just ignore this and keep stanning it?
"I don't know if you were racing each other or just the clock, the but truck got a much better launch. The ""speed advantage"" looks to be about what the launch timing advantage was."
Sick intro
you just had to compare to regular teslas. at first they were unique but now no-one cares if they see one on the road. now the only thing about regular teslas is to conclude if the owner is a smug douche or not
"First thing I think of is Apple's AirPods. At first, it was kinda unconventional and people didn't know if they should love it or hate it, but then it became everyone's go-to and every company did the same thing, nowadays, its normal to see and doesn't feel weird. Same with the PS5, at first it looked foreign and unique, now it is iconic and something everyone has that set the bars very high for the industry."
Is that a world record time?
"Only saw pictures of it before but yesterday I saw one in my town and (sorry Elon) it was the most butt ugly vehicle I have seen in my 58 years. Looked MUCH worse in person.
Not saying it is a bad vehicle, I guess if it works ok and you like the looks of it go for it but I wouldn't be seen in one!"
stopping in the middle of the road and cam by using phone. yo thats Dangerous.
"You have a very strange definition of iconic. Three iPod with click wheel is iconic. It certainly wasn‚Äôt rare. Or the  SX-70 Polaroid. Again, not rare."
Not sure who you are talking to but it is the ugliest thing on the road. It's not Iconic. I will only be remembers as the DeLorean rip off.
"Iconic or moronic? üòÑ

""Days after launch, you sit at a red light. The novelty is gone, you aren't any happier. Maybe it's your imagination but the gaps in the door look off. You think you saw a car full of teens laughing at you earlier. You're now 100k in debt for a meme, and you feel nothing."""
It attracts attention like a car wreck. It's unusual not well designed. Excellent video as always.
"Lol, no. Lolololol no"
"this is not a truck, from any angle, i dont like electric engines or motors"
"""which thanks to the dynamics of a refrigerator, not great"" lmao love that line this was such a killer vid <3 the drag race break down was wild!"
"Such a great video man, such a wholesome video. I was thinking if there are millions of videos on this and I have watched every single one of them what different is this video going to do? But yet again marques pulls up something interesting that you eagerly feel like watching. Great stuff, great way to go about a topic which is already juiced out to its limits."
the most dangerous thing about the cybertruck is the lack of a crumple zone
"The truck looks cool but it doesn‚Äôt at the same time. Idk, I would get one if I could though. It‚Äôs like that weird cool"
Tesla's hype will soon be over with BYD entering the game in the US market.
"Any other company providing something in such a state would get mercilessly ridiculed.  The panel gaps, trunks that can cut your fingers off, most stain-able car in existence, steering wheel that falls apart after 2 months, misaligned doors, headrests that peel if you don't use specific shampoos, a bunch of promised features missing, exact height and sharp for cracking pedestrians, so reflective it blinds other drivers around you, useless tray, has barely-functional crumple zones meaning you take all the forces in a crash. Honestly a joke that this is getting any air time at all just based on some gimmicks of it looking different.

Imagine if the next iphone had so many issues/problems."
"Only thing I hate about CT is that it's a truck. The design language, the tech, it's all awesome, but they had to make yet another chubby SUV out of it."
Loving the quality of the video
"Drives incredibly ridiculous looking car, who's main selling point was its gimmicky looks,  and is surprised that people look at it... That is half the reason these nerds are buying it!"
That drag race is so good ‚ù§
"The back and forth transitions (indoor space ‚Üí in vehicle ‚Üí lot)

Being a beta tester of an ugly truck that's expensive and not screwed together well and thus can killl you. No!

Kinda laughing that this one isn't on Autofocus. Marques saves the smaller channel for Fisker. Don't waste those Tesla views!

People mass buying these is everything wrong with America
Needed to shoot some wide shots
VW Beatles is iconic throughout the generations
"It's still a fact that cars are only used 6% of their total life.  The average american drives 30 miles per day only. In this day and age, this truck is completely unnecessary for anyone who lives  in a major city or doesn't use this kind of vehicle for work purposes."
"13:55 Marques talking about comparison with the 911, followed by casually walking towards it and straight up comparing the vehicles himself. Chills! (that beat drop added in the scene too)"
"20:58 'Yaw' is pivoting left and right, not up and down. That's 'pitch'. 'Pitch' is the nose moving up and down (x-axis); 'Roll' is the nose tilting or banking left and right (z-axis); 'Yaw' is the nose pivoting or swiveling left and right (y-axis). (All assuming you're viewing a vehicle from the back end and is facing away from you and you're using a 3-dimensional grid)."
Loved watching this video. It felt very high-quality change from seen to seen
"hahahahahaha, unobtainium, literally the cringiest word/idea from the last Avatar movie ‚Ä¶and probably the fate of the Cybertruck ‚Ä¶well the name itself is just as cringy as unobtanium :D"
30 minutes and no mention to the rusting materials. That‚Äôs iconic
I love this car....
I prefer a Cadillac Escalade..
It's because the internet is not the real world.
CyberVomit
Tesla cars are ugly.  It looks like the vehicle from the movie Aliens.  But then Tesla is not the first electric cars made and sold in fact their were plenty of electric cars in the early 1900s.  I can't stand Tesla products and Elon Musk is an awful human being.
Is this a sponsored video? ...
Im a fan marques
"The amount of effort put into this video was such a dramatic step up from the usual AF shot-on-iPhone video! Lots of impressive shots and work into it, congrats - the result was amazing."

Loved this video. What a crazy car! Futuristic!
Justin Bieber own one of the Cybertrucks
Just because something is attention grabbing doesn‚Äôt make it good.
The take of how it makes other behave on how dangerous it is complete fail. The bs plausible deniablity and reduction in accountability in shitty choices in a product because its whatever is completely dumb. this car dependency mindset is why this country sucks

IDK man driving around in upstate south carolina in my model 3 I still get wows from people. I think CT is gonna be iconic for a while.
The truck BURNS through tired. Less than 2000 miles and tires are balding.
he only drive hellcat
"As a motorcyclist, I'd much rather a head on with a Cybertruck than an F150.
You'd just slide right over it, can't imagine the horror of the Ford impact."
"Let's be honest bro, that truck is on it's way to be purely a ""Hype Truck."""
How long are you going to milk this content?
"As someone who can't even see himself driving anything other than a manual. Living in a small country in Europe and wanting personality, functionality and durability over anything I don't think I can ever see myself driving something like this. It doesn't afford me to be able to fix it or ""play"" with it. I will say I see a lot of positive takes in this video and I will even say I agree on some of the good things to be said about it. But take for example the electric steering. I can't ever imagine not feeling the road. I used to be a sailor and I remember coming on this boat where they had a newer steering system so I couldn't feel the current and the sea. Never had I felt more out of touch with something I was otherwise extremely familiar with. Anyway thought thoughts thought I think I'll go to bed now."
I saw this yesterday
"If Apple made the Cybertruck, they would sell it for 250k a pop and they would sell like hot cakes"
America and Canada will see the cyber truck and the rest of the world not
"Please don't compare Cybertruck to Countach. I really like the design of the Cybertruck and it's kind of... specific, but the Countach is just a masterpiece"
"As always, another brilliant video. Every journalist and America could learn what real journalism looks like from watching Marquis. That said, the only small disagreement I have is the possible comparison to the PT cruiser. The PT cruiser was a throwback design, not really a new design. But a small nitpick"
7:29 that's the thing: you won't. Because of how strong it is.
"Load Tesla Stocks, selling at discount right now"
"With the iconic point i think its gonna have its tesla moment, where the tesla was the cool car on the street until it was the electric car on the street, which this will be the cybertruck until it becomes the electric truck."
"Where did he get those ""% of truck owners who tow"" numbers?"
Bruv where is your darn RED
Bro respect the country
0-60 in what full tank will catch ya
It‚Äôs both ugly and cool. It‚Äôs cool because it‚Äôs ugly and sci-fi. Lol
"The Beetle is iconic and mass produced, so is the Cybertruck.  Comparing the Cybertruck to the PT Cruiser ignores everything you did in this video, the PT Cruiser did not have any innovative features to it.  Something is wrong with the logic of this video, seems so easy to understand and Marques is struggling here."
"Ugliest car, will be scrap in a few years."
The Cybertruck is probably Tesla‚Äôs trial to see the consumers reaction to the design. This design will prolly become common and come to the Model X and Model S‚Ä¶ Depending if the consumers like this kinda design or not‚Ä¶
"Just to put in perspective, all the examples Marques gave of people‚Äôs reactions of the looks - not one of those was ‚Äúlooks good‚Äù."
I think it looks pretty cool.  Will look great with a wrap.
The only thing iconic about the cyber truck is your review
"""I cannot tell if the cybertruck is good looking or not""
Let me help you out here! It's not. Hope this helps!"
"When Marques said ""my child"" it was showing Miles and I thought he was talking about him üòÇ"
"The Cyber truck is iconic because there's nothing like it. There were other mass produced cars that were iconic as well.

We should celebrate cars that are different. Especially if they are successful. That's the reason the cybertruck has the amount of attention and pre-orders it does. Because it's different. 

It's unfortunate to see people like that biker take a negative stance against it. Like if you don't like the look of it, sure I get it. That's understandable. But that biker sounded like he was giving it a thumbs down for some arbitrary reason."
Good point you made at the end.
almost half an hour attempting to twist into a pretzel in the hope of gaslighting himself out of the glaring buyer's regret.
This is a different portrayal of the cyber truck compared to the unbiased opinion uploaded in Auto Focus. I am really hoping Marques did not sell out
"It amazes me howmuch haters there are in the comment section, and pretty much everybody in real life loves this car...
Proves those haters are living in their moms basement, never seen daylight, just dumb keyboard warriors.
Pretty sad if you ask me..."
Elon actually said the Cybertruck can beat a 911 in a quarter mile while towing a 911
"Tell this builder to find a trick to reach 3.3 mm sheet metal edges. Obviously it is not the job of an Artistic Director to see the figure doubled or quadrupled
business of this company with the construction of city sites 500 meters high. In addition to the capital already available to
the location of the construction to be able to provision all the workforce Its business plan seems to be the most bizarre as if everything depended on SIGNIFICANT drops in quality after sale, very highly predictable upon delivery of this pack which resembles a re-discovery of the COCA-COLA‚ú®‚ú®üß†ü•Çü•Ç drink in the 1920's.


If the cybertruck becomes a luxury commodity exclusively reserved by a group of people solely paid for DESIGN with an American artistic vocation. Asians will fill this void from here
2030 will put this great brand in rout all over the African continent, where all the precious minerals are located and all the largest construction sites concerned by these fleets of all-terrain vehicles with their essential characteristic glow.

Let TESLA END with this artistic wonder of pseudo-science fiction surpassing BY policies of the idealization of the CITY OR Urban ENVIRONMENTS.

THIS type of EV-TRUCK not yet achieved in these means of production reflects the gap that exists between the brand and the future millions of other Buyers --POTENTIAL-- or EXIT OF THEIR GRILLING CELL BY THE Asian manufacturer
MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND...MUCH MORE...Ancient in the prod nightmare process.

"I dont understand.  You take a video of it while driving, ... when do you EVER go back and re-watch that video?  Like why?"
@0:45 looks like Rico Bosco üòÜ
"I'm not beta-testing a car that can't even come assembled properly that comes from a manufacturer that still has a reputation for poor QA in even their 'established' older cars. Marques has really low standards for what makes an 'iconic' or even a good car.

Also you can tell Marques has a vested interest in remaining positive towards Tesla because he never brings up how bad Tesla QA is in general and he refused to mention the $20k Foundation Fee that basically has you pre-paying for a feature that isn't available at launch. For someone who preaches about buying something for what it is now and not the promise of what it can/could be, he's a helluva hypocrite when it comes to reviewing Tesla cars. The bootlicking is disgusting."
"Turbo S twice the price of a Cyberbeast, Carrera T starts around the price of a foundation series Cyberbeast (so a Cyberbeast with 20k markup, and does 12.2s 1/4 mile..."
"yet another nail in that Cyberturd coffin, badly designed, badly made, and dangerous for everyone"
"Sorry no it isn‚Äôt fine that people buy this truck or any truck and drive it on the streets where actual people walk, without any intent to use it at its intended purpose. It‚Äôs wasteful, dangerous and terrible for the environment - yes even an electric vehicle. What an indictment on our specifies. Catch a train."
Seen a few up close on the road. Ugly is an insult to ugly vehicles.  It‚Äôs beyond hideous.
I think it‚Äôs larger than a model because they are all iconic in one way or another.  What‚Äôs iconic is the Tesla brand.
I guess daddy Elon was upset about MKBHD‚Äôs hot take on the cyberdump build quality and panel gaps. Now he has to make a video to call it iconic
"I can t like it, i can t! Jeez it s ugly"
try xiaomi SU7 plz
The Cybertruck is as iconic as the PT Cruiser.
They just want that Brownlee Selfie
That overhead shot when racing was perfect
the intro is just wrong. the most dangerous thing about the cybertruck is the frunk lid closing and chopping of your fingers
"Businesses will buy this for 2 reasons. marketing and attention. good for the businesses. wrap it with your biz logo and phone numbers as well as your Q R code. would i personally buy it? sure ,if i had the money for it. is it a goal of mine to get one? no. i would rather buy the Rivian R3. it wouldn't be practical  for my daily usage. have a great day and Happy Easter everyone."
"Once again, Marques, you've delivered a fine video."
If you understood anything about product design and you would know that rarity has got nothing to do with being iconic or not what a baseless on educated deeply flawed observation based on nearly ego rather than a genuine research into the subject
"No, no, no Steering by wire should not even be rated. It is just stupid. The delay is crazy, and no, I do not want to play a video game. I want to feel the car."
Even for Tesla factory is very complicate to put all the stainless steel panels together. I think nobody will repair this cyber trucks after any accidents. And insurance must be in Ferrari category price
Hey Marques! Where‚Äôs your 911 review? Waiting for that
Not in the snow. Straight üóë
No the reason there are no cars looking like this is because cars companies are soundly uninnovative
"High quality review as always, but it's disappointing that you didn't mention the negative consequences of millions of people driving around 7000 lb. vehicles with tall metal hoods.  The amount of damage these things will do in crashes will be huge compared to smaller or lighter cars.  It's clearly something you're aware of -- you emphasized that ~the driver~ will be fine in collisions.

An honest review of these things needs to at least mention the negative externalities that everyone else on the road will have to deal with."
this guy was less boring when he used to talk about phones only. Now he is always looking for Elon Musk to notice him. BORING
"What's the cyber beast that he mentioned, is that a different model or something?"
"overpriced. this thing was supposed to be $49,900"
Tesla cyber truck review: Already trash?
"Yeah, we know you‚Äôre serious when you say you don‚Äôt understand good design"
"Thanks for another engaging, funny and informative review!"
"Remember things like the mini were iconic when they first came out, were still iconic throughout the production of millions of them, and remain iconic today. Just the CT gets tarnished by the once loveable and now loonatic face of the company"
Marmite vehicle
"I saw one Friday afternoon. It is even more hideous than a Rivian, which was the most unsightly thing on wheels since Lyndon Johnson rode in a parade in a '58 Edsel convertible."
Your truck will be fine if you crash but you will not be fine sitting in a rigid metal box with no crunble zone.
‚ÄúThanks to the aerodynamics of a refrigerator‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ
"Honestly the Cybertruck isn't a bad design. It isn't a good design. It's all in the eye of the beholder. It's all subjective, design language always is. Trying to say it's objectively a bad design is like trying to say past generations has objectively bad fashion sense. Nah, it's all subjective, and tastes change over time. People in a few decades will say we had terrible fashion sense. And then they might say this was a great design because most future vehicles look that way."
So sick!
Iconic like Fiat Multipla ‚ù§
"1:07 says it all. People who know the truck know it's terrible, and people who dont know anything about it think it's cool.  ü§£"
Why'd it have to be the biker :( Marques I promise there's lots of really cool bikers out there!
"Wow! Bullet proof? I am sure the gang leaders are going to take notice, and maybe the Police? It is a fad that will fade away, as it and EV's in general, will NOT save the planet."
Enjoyed watching this
Great editing on the intro. Really hit the point home
"@10:04 as he speaks about ""Truck Stuff"" and a broll in which Cyber truck in between two huge trucks that looks like truck drivers are paid actors xD (jokes apart that was a SICK üî•shot)"
"yes, iconic ugly... the new Fiat Multipla."
"So, is the EV Hummer better than the cyber truck?"
I mean if you mean iconic in the same way a Pontiac Aztec is iconic then maybe?
Already ironic!
"Bring it to Finland üá´üáÆ  in winter then talk 'fly by wire'. A frozen Cybertruck is still a fridge on wheels, and cut the range by a third. I always catch your videos when I can. -Cheers üçªüçª"
"It reminds me of when Toney Stark created the first iron man in a cave‚Ä¶ it was the first one, didn‚Äôt look really good. Now look what happened to the suite now. Crazy right?"
Reminds me of GTA haha
"This is as close to the ""Batmobile"" as I'm ever going to get....I'LL TAKE IT!!!"
"The PT Cruiser was never Iconic or Cool
The Volkswagen Beatle is a mass produced iconic car. Both concepts can coexist.
Also the Eiffel Tower when is was erected was seen by the artistic community as awful and a blight to Paris."
Right here to tell you that I appreciate and love your creativity with your videos and clarity.
They see me B ROLLin'
"One of the greatest and iconic videos ever made by mkbhd, thumbs up for the dragrace scene and production value! 
I'm a long time viewer, sice 2014! I liked the ronin and boom mic in the reflection. :)"
"I don't like that vehicle. You know people built cars to get somewhat destroyed in a crash for a reason. It's to protect the people inside and outside of the car by absorbing a lot of force. This ""truck"" (which isn't a truck by my definition) is just dangerous especially considering what kind of people will buy these. It's people who don't care about others, who want to be the first all the time, who always get their own will and who are the most insecure. Dangerous people in dangerous cars. This is just wrong."
Nice race against the Porsche. I would choose the 911 any time over the cybertruck as the Porsche is a design icon and simply more appealing and last but not least one of the best engineered cars on the planet in my humble opinion.
Get a Matte Black Wrap on THISSSS!!
"Thanks for referencing Engineering Explained and his video debunking that bs about a Cybertruck beating a 911 on a quarter mile while towing. Imo it's kinda embarrassing to make such weird claims or trying to even imply it.

If you really want to beat a 911 on a 1/4 mile, just get a Model S Plaid (or a Model X)."
"13:05 ""...and that's fine."" ‚Äî It's alarming how we tolerate the presence of 3,000 kg supercars capable of causing devastating harm if mishandled, solely for their aesthetic appeal.

These vehicles hold immense potential energy, with their weight and power translating into considerable momentum under the driver's control, posing significant risks in urban settings.

I‚Äôm saddened by the fact that influential figures like Marques overlook these dangers while promoting such vehicles as mere fashion statements, disregarding the unnecessary risks they pose to society."
"23:50 You always have to invert biker opinions. So, that's positive also."
Thy should have named it the Incel Camino.

Review the new Xiaomi Su7
"21:47 Buttonless or digital controls are also beneficial in that their state can be attached per driver profile. This is one of the biggest benefits of not having manual air vents, that they can always be in the preferred setting for each driver no matter which Tesla in their possession they get into. This minimalism was always going to be key in the robotaxi experience but it has yet to be realized."
"I don't understand, you did a review already with the autofocus channel with crap iPhone footage. Why do it again?

It‚Äôs an icon of absurdity. I wrote this using Starlink while holding my not-a-flamethrower.
The production on this is next level! Great job guys ü§ôü§ô
I don't understand the hate . Its a concept car gone into mass production.  They will be sold out for the next 3y and by then all questionable features will be taken care off.
"Great video, as usual Marques. You continually bring good content.  A couple things though, the CT's exterior panels are not stamped, they are laser cut and bent. Some of the sub structure is stamped, but that's made of regular mild steel (plus the large aluminum castings).

And I have a very simple solution to the fingerprint problem: Open the door on that top edge, slipping your hand behind the door panel (this is how we open our model 3). And close the door with you hip or butt. It isn't doing to scratch it, and you won't leave body oils on the SS.  As far as other people are concerned? They should not be touching it without your permission anyway? That's just rude.  Just like riding another person's horse without permission, people need to learn to keep their paws off. And teach the kids the same at a young age as well. You see it all the time at car shows, parents taking young kids through, and teaching the kids, don't touch the car, just look. At least the smart ones do."
3:30 What price would people have guessed if you first told them it accelerates faster than a corvette. That would add up more.
"Marques is set up by Elon and the FBI to create a psychologically oppressed environment around the world, in fact, he also conspired alongside jschatt the 9-11 atta-"
"No mention of the questionable politics behind this thing isn‚Äôt great. Should it not be mentioned at some point in the review that a large number of people think that being seen in this thing means you‚Äôre financially supporting an openly transphobic and xenophobic racist? Probably in the section about getting 80% disgusted looks? No mention at all about why that is?

I‚Äôm an adult and I get why. But it doesn‚Äôt make it any less disappointing."
Willing beta tester personifies Tesla owners.. sadly
Still think this car looks weird... ü§î
"What is the deal with zoomers overusing the word ""iconic""?"
TechRax drove through that deep water and it broke like half of his electronics lol
Can you review a cyber truck with a 6‚Äù drop?
"I mean the Pinto was an iconic car, that doesn't make it good, but oh boy Pintos are iconic"
Iconic Eye Sore....
BahahahahüòÇüòÇüòÇ wait till it rusts
"Iconic yet mass produced. Probably have to go to iconic tech products like the iPod or the original colorful iMacs. And just like those products, the iconic nature will fade over time to a degree, unlike the Bugatti with only five hundred ever made"
Miles V Marques whaaaat
Lexus has had the steer by wire on some vehicles for a year or two now
Cyberbeast: 130mph top speed ... doesn't cut it for me.  Need to be at least 180mph at least.
Dangerous + Car = not a good match lol
"So far ive only seen 2 of them out on the roads but im not a daily driver.....       i think its funny how so many people want them to race against Porsche sports cars but i think alot more people will also want them just to be able to use as a means of transportation, so i think Tesla will sell as many as they can make ..."
Thatll go away
Imagine how much it would cost to get Brownlee to give such a lick spittle polish to your product.
Nissan has never made a race car.
mkbhd vs adam something lmao
I‚Äôve watch all his Cybertruck reviews. Their just fun. Thanks Marcus.
"marques, it was obviously not a panel gap from the beginning. i don't know why you called it that.  the door was obviously not shutting all the way."
"Elon has left his mark, people should catch up"
"this fingerprint ""worry"" is silly....and solvable.  just put a stylishly cut piece of vinyl wrap on the areas that would be attacked by fingers. there."
Minecraft started coming to life
"Da Markus bei 15:15 ein Trikot des Deutschen Frisbeesport-Verband e.V. tr√§gt, ist dieser Kommentarbereich nun Eigentum der Bundesrepublik Deutschland."
Why do Cybertruck drivers think that their being cool is more important than the safety of others?
Looks lit AF if you see it in person
"I wonder how many Tesla shares does this guy have. Constantly makes Tesla vides to make them look good, and any other EVs are titled ""Worst Car Ever"""
This design will not age well.
This car looks sick! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Lol why the Deutsche Frisbee-Verband""- Shirt?!"
Did you get paid by Tesla for this?
"I really like your videos. However you should have mentioned the danger this truck will pose to everyone else on the road. More and more Americans are being killed and disabled every year by vehicles, largely due to the popularity of large vehicles like this that protect the driver but put everyone else in danger."
PT Cruisers are iconic.
Imagine getting t-boned by this on route 80. I don‚Äôt get how this thing is regulation.
the most dangerous thing about the ChumpTruck is the amount of kinetic energy that will get transferred to the vital organs of the passengers during a high speed impact.
The cyber truck bot working with CCS is something worth mentioning. Ive only heard Kyle from out of spec mention that.
"The race that Musk tried to deceive people that the Cyber truck can beat a Porsche towing another Porsche is not the ""smart"" bit, it's disingenuous at best, outright scam-y at worst. The fact that Marques doesn't think is a big deal and its ""fun"", tells you all you need to know about this guy trustworthiness..."
"How else loves the background music in the introduction? 0:40
üëá"
Are you gonna get it a D-brand skin?
The Cybertruck is an ugly design. I'm not a fan of its look. BUT! Designs and fashion trends have stagnated so hard. We do need that jump forward to more forward.
"It's very, very ugly. Both the exterior and the interior, i hate it."
"This truck, in Italy, especially in Rome... It won't move an inch."
"cybertruck MOGS everything on the street rn and you cannot change my mind
its the ultimate mogger machine :(
i wish i was driving around in one. 
dont want a million dollar porche 911 , dont want a lambo , a ferrari , i want this truck"
Are you getting paid for each mention of the product name? This could be a drinking game for every time you say Cybertruck.
Huge safety problems?
"Does the interior have the same room (leg, head, shoulder, hip) as the Y?  More or less?  Tesla wouldn‚Äôt let me sit in one."
"I HATE! this truck. It's not really a truck and I laugh at everyone I see. Also the forum of the truck doesn't meet some safety standards, also it looks like the honda ridgeline so not a new look, oh also the avalanche has this look"
cybertruck = flamboyant
"What a great video! I liked it - by a lot - better than other videos of you (not as if they were bad, or anything). I find it way more entertaining if you switch the location you are at and where you are talking from every few spots. You should definitely do this on smartphone reviews too! Moderating from different locations. I see it on other YouTube Chanels as well. I am not saying, you should get rid of your style. I like your videos. However, it is keeping my attention up way more and is more appealing (at least) to me."
i think the Cybertruck is the new g wagon
I disagree it can totally be used as a work truck it wont be able to tow something for as long as a 450 ford but it can tow the same weight.
How much Tesla paid you to praise this piece of crap?
Am I the only who find it weird that a 27 minute video reviewing a car didn't mention once safety ?
The audio sounds so hissy?
Excellent balanced impartial review.
The SBW feature is a game changer
Woher hat er das deutsche Trikot? ü§î

This is for people who want a G wagon
"You spent about 7:20 of a 27:23 video talking about ""performance"" when really you were just talking about acceleration.  Not one mention of stopping this incredibly heavy, battering ram that looks like it was designed to end pedestrians and bicyclists.  How about a stopping test from 60 with the Porsche?  nah...... thats no fun."
I really like the ending words of your videos.
"Edsel was ""iconic"" in an equal way... also disappointed to see that Marcus is a shill üò¢"
"Paid promotion üòÖ,noice üòÅ"
"Everyone knows the hype of the cyber truck pero NO, IS NOT A PRETTY OR NICE DESIGN"
"Not iconic, another word that ends in 'onic'."
Where does he buy his hoodies??
Ioniq 5 will be a more iconic design long term
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Jesus didn‚Äôt come into the world to condemn the world but to save the world. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. üëçüèΩ
I enjoy following the car world a little and I think it's fun that you've kind of expanded into that space.  Your videos are always so solid and well thought out and it's always great to hear another perspective.
Def. got a fat check from Tesla to do this video
German Frisbee? Why's that?
Absolutely no one buys a Cyber Truck because they NEED a truck. They buy it because they WANT a truck.
"I used to own an Isuzu Impulse.  You'll have to look it up, but this car had a body designed by Giugiaro, and nothing else on the road at the time looked like it.  I got used to the head-turning, but then I moved to the East Coast.  The Impulse was mostly a failure, and was only imported to the West Coast, so I had one of only about three of these cars on the East Coast.  That made me stand out like a sore thumb.  Since no one had ever heard of it, no one turned thumbs down.  Everyone just boggled.  So I think the 80/20 you're seeing reflects that the 20% who hate it, are already familiar with it.  If it were completely unknown, as my car was, you'd see 100% boggle/0% any other reaction."
"Summary, vanity purchase."
"Good promotion for elon üòÇ
Tired of this ev reviews"
"Aww for fucks sake marques, out of all the people who could have gotten it wrong, YOU are saying tesla is the first to do it? No they are not. This is a reminder that this is a *tech* channel and not a car channel, and that tesla is a *tech* company not a car company"
As with all things in life I think there‚Äôs something for everyone and the Cybertruck just doesn‚Äôt seem to be something for me. I have no problems with it but I also don‚Äôt feel that if I had the choice to buy that over another vehicle that I‚Äôd choose the Cybertruck.
Kinda feel like you should have mentioned the security concerns regarding passenger and pedestrian safety...
Love the camera work in this video! Well made video :)
Most political car ever made so of course there will be a lot of hate
Iooks good
0:21 The novelty will wore off in 4 months and all you will see is a bunche of cybertucks left rusted in the side of the highway cause they can't be towed properly and the cost of repairs is not worth it üòÇ
Draw a car only using a ruler... That's a Tesla cyber truck
and now ppl hate  pt cruisers
"I can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt mention rusting.

"Bulletproof to standard 9x19mm isn't much to shake a stick at... 
I wouldn't call it overrated, I'd call it a good standard to go by."
"About what you said in the ending. The guy who thumbs down and the others who thumbs up.

I think to build something meaningful you will make something who some will love and others hate.

With this said I think this car horrible. Maintenance with the chassis will be expensive or ugly"
The intro was insane good job Marques.
Why you deleting hate comments about the car?
Dude! enough with the Cybertruck
Why is everyone taking the hub caps off?
The car doesn‚Äôt have four corners tho üò¨üò¨üò¨ but he said ‚Äúwithin those four corners‚Äù‚Ä¶

"marques, what do you want/expect in the back??  it's a pickup truck. i'd say for a pickup the back is as stylish as you could expect."
"This is literally a death machine. So are pickup trucks and oversized SUVs. Any pedestrian struck will be immediately dead and smaller cars will be instantly totaled. A problem that the majority of the US sees, but not as much in Europe."
"Live it up.  That truck is a ridiculous example of American elitist excess. It‚Äôs a turd, dude.  You‚Äôre just too ate up to notice it."
We need a Xiaomi SU7 review from you man!
"Next up, cybercar"
What is the clicking sound at minute 6
I don't trust anything backed by elon
"Who cares what people say? It is a great car, full stop."
"If you have the opportunity in the future, make review on Xiaomi su7"
"The Plymouth Prowler is a better equivalent to the Cybertruck. Back 1997 Chrysler CEO Bob Lutz called it an exercise in polarity, just as like the Cybertruck. Both attract insane attention, both used unconventional megatrials, Prowler, aluminum and the Cybertruck Stainless steel. And both were/are heavily criticized for not being good at what they're suppose to be ."
trust me - if you like being photographed and if you want to get only positive feedback while driving a stainless steel car.. get a dmc-12 delorean. i know what i am talking about! :-) cheers!
I did cancel mine. The range is pathetic üòÆ
Yes the stainless steel has its flaws especially by being a fingerprint magnet. Easy fix is to wrap it surely. And im sure people will being that its only available in the one colour
Big fan of the Missy Elliot ‚ÄúLose Control‚Äù aesthetic at 13:22
"Not only is it overpriced, it's ugly as sin. I kept looking for the gun turrets. I've seen them on the road, and they're hideous.Anybody who spends that kind of money on a vehicle that damn ugly means they've got more money than common sense."
"steer by wire shouldnt be allowed imo. there needs to be a fixed mechanical link between the driver and steers. at least when your traditional rack n pinion or box type power steering failed, you could still steer the car with a bit more effort but with a steer by wire setup, if either end of the steering fails, what happens? im assuming there is no physical connection?! 
i have driven a car with a lane assist that would actually turn the wheels without the steering wheel if you wandered in the lane without an indicator on. it could only do it so far before disabling but to turn the wheel to the left and the car resists and goes right is a disconcerting feeling to say the least."
He is trying his hardest to make Elon's rust bucket cool with an these videos.
Iconically ugly with the same Tesla bullshit you get with their other cars.
Incredible production quality! I definitely need to see how some of these shots were made. And I definitely got super duper hyped when I saw the intro animation! SICK AS HECK!
My i3 does the same over 10 years after the launch üòÇ
Epic video! Loved it! And thanks for a new word - unobtainium. üòÅ
brb.. gotta update my gpu driver. car isn't rendering
the main argument against any tesla is the connection to eron. as sad as it is.
The fact that this dude video is #12 on trending on top of getting almost 2 mil views in a day good shyt brotha üëè
I saw a tesla in Nigeria I almost gone mad
This truck will kill anyone it hits. This is not a good thing.
"To me, it looks like something I would have drawn as a small child, a car of the future, I was born in the early 70s"
Maybe if Lambo had reduced the price of their cars by 90% and built millions of them they would be where Tesla is today.
And that‚Äôs why drivers don‚Äôt like bikers
"Wealthy people are ruining this country. 
USA is bad"
"Suddenly, the video changed from MKBHD style to Top Gear (legacy, of course)."
Yo that intro is CRAZY!
"I mean, it's not every day that the Pontiac Aztec gets its title of ""Ugliest Vehicle"" taken away. It's like gawkers at an accident, except this one is still driving."
Finally saw one while eating lunch with a co-worker. Both of our jaws dropped. Thing looked incredible.  So cool.
LOL. You got Musked
This thing is iconically dumb
"The bullet proof body has me wondering, in a worst case front on collision. Does the crumple zone do its thing?"
the production value litteraly looks like an actually good advertisment

As of March 31st 2024 I have yet to see a single Cybertruck on the road.
"it‚Äôs interesting, but it looks like something a chinese sweatshop factory designed, then sold on temu"
I like how this is more interesting than any Lamborghini or Ferrari.
Oh yea... I never buy a low-vin anything. Learned that the hard way with an Audi that kept falling apart.
"Ofc they have to behave, because a crash would be devastating, for everyone outside the car"
Island Dragway!!!
waiting when TESLA malaysia will brought this :(
Being bulletproof is overrated? Bros definitely not from the hood üòÇ
Celebritruck draws aaaaaaaalll the attention üòÖ
It reminds me of the Jaw Titan from AOT
When I got my model 3...I immediately had more aggressive drives toward me than ever. Racing me...cutting me off...of trying to make me crash. It's the brand all together that's making my driving experience both better....and really annoying.
This video just shows how the us auto market e completely disconnected from the rest of the World. The fact that the F150 (which is a HUGE truck anywhere else) is the best selling car in the country and almost nobody uses the truck bed is baffling to me!
"7:25 ""If someone hits you, you'll be fine."" Small correction there, YOU won't be fine - the Cybertruck easily surviving a crash makes you the crumple zone! :)"
"It's ugly. 
I love it."
"26:35 can confirm PT Cruiser was extremely popular when it came out. Its throwback design got the older crowd excited, and the fuel economy got everyone excited. Gas prices were rising like crazy at the time."
"The intro is unreal, WoooooooW"
The continuity/discontinuity of putting his hood up to match the outdoor shot and the black sweatshirt attempting to mimic the black jacket. üíØ
Hi Marques! Is it true that the cybertruck rusts easily? What‚Äôs your take on that?
Think this is one of the best produced car reviews I have ever seen on Youtube. Great video and fascinating car. Truck. Fridge on wheels.
Refrigerator power bank ready to be on fire
Its one of the best video you ever made.
Love it
"It would have been interesting to talk about the security-issues with it, since its not allowed in the EU and that you are definetly that when that things rolls over you, because you will be underneath it when it runs into you because of its shape."
How did bankrupting fisker feel?
14:18 Miles is a CHAMPION !!!
"The PT cruiser segment is dead on. When it was released, it was the hottest car on the road, like a viper. My parents put deposits down for it, everyone thought it was the coolest thing ever."
"Man, I love my man Doug, but Marques got the production quality on lock!"
"LMAO comparing this thing to the PT cruiser is so funny, the only reason people bought those was because of how cheap they were."
"I've turned and have seen people turn their heads with new cars on the road (doesn't matter what it is) and after a while this goes away. It's not an Icon,  just something new. Pretty soon it will be just the norm. Losing your cool to hype."
"im still in an area in Northeast PA where i get excited just seeing tesla model S's and X's. I have yet to see the refreshed model 3 out here. just saw my first rivian r1s yesterday. Seeing the first cybertruck in person will be probably the most exciting thing car wise that i will be able to see in my area for a long time. It will stay iconic. even if i see 20 that day. In my opinion, we will all most likely get desensitized to the overall look but i think it will always be iconic, unlike the PT cruiser lmao"
"Dude, the intro is so cool. shout out that guy"
"Cool design, but why isn't it half the size ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Hummer EV has identical rear wheel steer angle 4 years earlier....
The cybertruck side angle is how every little kid draws a truck lol
"I think a huge sticking point that is missed out in this cybertruck review, people arnt just disgusted by the design they are disgusted by the person that made the cybertruck and what he stands for. Elon Musk, owning and buying a cybertruck is a very online person deal and that very online person knows about teh antics of elon Musk, knows what hateful crap he spews out on a daily basis, by activley buying a cybertruck you ARE supporting elon Musk, no way around it. If the Cybertruck was made by VW for example it would not get nearly the amount of hate it does. But because its a tesla and the face of that company is very public with his ideoligies the cybertruck will forever be hated on and the people that actively drive them."
He wasn't lying when he said this is the best video he has ever made
"People are so confused in the comments: ""I'd NEVER drive a car without crumple zones..."""
This car ist the EV equivalent of former Hummer owners telling the world how many actual effs they give.
don't u have a car channel... why am I getting this when I'm not interested in this topic
Good car. Ugly car
"Generally, when you fill a whole mug,  you should aim to have about 2 (horizontal) fingers of foam.  If you like more, then do more, at the end you are the one who is drinking it, have it the way it tastes the best for you!"

Breaks out white board to do the Engineering Explained Jason Fenske thing‚Ä¶.  MKBHD and Jason need to do a video together ASAP!  Pairing would be interesting IMHO.
I think you should keep the car staff separated from this channel
"My child, Oh! My car."
"Its front view is so much like The ""Iron Man"" Helmet!!"
well maybe the biker gave you a thumbs down because he knows if he gets hit by one of those things his mortality is much higher than with a car that isnt made of fucking steel panels
"I need to know if this would be a good work truck. I'm a contractor and wile I don't tow much of anything I do haul everyday so would this be a good truck to work out of with my guys needing moved from job to job, driving from street to dirt to mud back to street in a few yards, constant hauling of drywall, hauling 8ft and 10ft studs and posts, moving lots of tools and equipment exc. If I could care less about keeping her shiny and new but I just need a good work truck to get the job done would this be for me? Keep in mind most good big work trucks are pushing 6 figures at the dealership and work vans are just come on man I'm not driving a dam van. So please look at this truck through my eye and tell us working men what's up with this thing."
the design style is like the cars in cyberpunk 2077.
So I guess these will be the new Escalade?
"Hate it or love it, it's a striking design. Personally love it. Shame it's a death machine that won't fly in Europe"
That intro was üî•
its a disaster
had to click the like button after that fire animation in the beginning
"Lexus has steer-by-wire so nope, they are not the first. However, it‚Äôs still miserably bad compared to old school not assisted steering experience."
Great analogy with the pt cruiser
Well it is iconic for its cost of repair and insurance. Good luck owning one.
"Just imagine, buying a car that is poorly made and making excuses that this is beta testing... How the f... If the wheels fall of when you're driving you will be still saying that this expected because this is ""beta testing""?"
That thing would be sweet with a V8 in it üòÇ
"Dude, don't call it crazy unobtainium; you'll have the RDA coming after you!"
"I think the second iteration will look good, this feels like a experiment still... the potential is there !!!"
The tyre pattern being misaligned from the rim bugs me so much.
"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Cybertruck is a big billboard for obnoxious. Everything that you just shouldn't do. It will never sell in millions or remotely close. I'd go as far as saying the program will shutter because of costs. It was an utterly terribly conceived project."
The most dangerous thing about Marques is also same.
Iconic? On what? Being useless pile of steele and plastic?
"It‚Äôs not good looking, and if would be in a accident you would get crushed. By the way, Driver front tire needs to be aligned it wobbles‚Ä¶"
Got nothing wrong with the design. The car sales and turns  heads
"How are people not talking about safety? Crumple zone save your life in an accident. Surely this car will kill people not just pedestrians with its sharp corners, but also the occupants??"
"""How much does it cost?""
""Your dignity"""
Marques you should 3D print caps for wheels
Your review is soooo above all the other ones on YouTube. 10/10 !!!
"Iconic why exactly? This is so strange to me that something on launch can be proclaimed ""iconic"". That's not how it works and whether it's mass produced or not has nothing to do with it. Hyped up is perhaps the word all these ""reviews"" are looking for."
Is it only one Cybertruck at the last part of the video? Because I cant see shadows on the Truck on your right.
IC ‚á¢ MOR
The drag race was faked. Cybertruck only Lead 1/8 mile after that the EV lost against le porsche
"How can the rear locker not work? That's hardware, how can it possibly not?"
Could you please add metric units again in your videos?
"That intro though. üòçüòç
Great job."
"I am not sure but these days I feel mkbhd reviews are getting a bit biased towards certain brands. 

Probably he is also influenced by his personal connections with those big CEO's, idk!"

"23:38 Bikers don't like huge, blocky cars. Big surprise."
they are not the 1st to do steerbywire
Mind reviewing the Xaomi EV
"For all you tesla weirdos, this truck is around 6500 lb maybe more? And it goes THAT fast? Yeah a  good amount of these will wear down the roads even faster. Good job"
"the behaviour of people as they get used to it goes, but the other dangers on it remain"
"When I was the first person around in a Nissan Leaf, the amount of attention I got was ridiculous. I can't imagine what it would be like in a Cybertruck."
Great stuff as always!
"I live in a RHD country where the model 3 took 1.5 year longer to release than USA, model Y closer to 2 year and last year model S & model X were cancelled perhaps never again to be built in RHD. Makes me wonder if the CyberTruck will ever come to Australia or if it will always be iconic? Ironically it would be simple to convert with the steer-by-wire.

I‚Äôve seen a Bugatti Veyron on the road but it was 17 years ago in Guernsey.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a Countach on the road but like everyone else had a poster."
Nah its disgusting
"Damn 
I have never such a good intro video ever...."
I never thought I would see Marques use a sledgehammer during a review
Always loved it. People love to hate for the sake of it.
I don't know but it was a refreshing video.
Not iconic just dangerous üòä
"The Cybertruck is iconic - and ugly in most people‚Äôs opinion.  I decided to not wait on the triple motor one I ordered and picked up a Hummer EV instead. It‚Äôs got the cool factor and rarity, 310mi range, full supercharger network access and looks amazing.  Everybody loves this thing, no offense to the designers but I‚Äôm very happy I went with this beautiful vehicle over an ugly, bulletproof set of vectors. 

I respect the ambition to do something different, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a conventional truck. This is more of a Elon trying to get rid of the steering wheel with a yoke and stalks on the steering wheel.  Sure you can do that, but there‚Äôs no need, and this is more of the same."
Simone's TRUCKLA solos this thing easilyü•±
So many dislikes wtf?
damn those stainless panels are stained
damn how does it feel for dry a car with playstation 1 graphics?? also tell me how marq isnt a musk fanboy
Great question to end on.
"The most ugly car ever produced, by miles. Like something a 5 year old would draw. Musk is just taking the piss."
An honest person would say the Cybertruck is a marvel ... Hence attracting all the attention... Perhaps it's the hatred for Musk which makes for the negative comments online
I could hear this guy on hour review and still not get tired

"I tell you what, Marcus is genuinely, consistently one of the best, most relatable reviewers out there. Conversational but with a point, and covers everything you need without it being boring. From the start nails the issues and talking points but wraps that into the experience of driving and general review. It's a really difficult thing to do well and still be compelling to watch. Just look at a lot of the macguffin type reviews out there that have an obnoxious click-me perspective. These reviews are absolutely the best in the business."

Cybertruck is a pile of rust where the driver can hardly see anything without the cameras and the headlights blind all other drivers and which has a loading area like a Piaggo tricycle.
"haven't heard anything good about this ""truck"". garbage range for how enormous it is, rusts, terrible wheels, and pretty ugly."
Won't the stainless steel be dangerous for pedestrians in case of accidental collisions?

"""It's hard to find something that's both mass produced and iconic."" VW Beetle. Ford Model T. The original Mini. '64 1/2 Mustang. Any version of a Honda EG. Any BMW 3-Series. Any generation of the Hilux. Any version of the FJ40 Land Cruiser. Any version of the Land Rover Defender. Every Corolla ever. And each CJ, YJ, TJ, JK, and JL ever since the war ended. And all of those are incredible actual cars that were designed and bought by real regular people; not a flex toy for the rich designed by some lunatic billionaire with an ego the size of the Cybertruck's track width"

No one is talking about the rust issue in the comments
"I know you've got an audience to maintain (no judgement there), but managing to mention Musk once(?) in a Cybertruck review is seriously impressive. Also personally, I think the design is cool as a concept but I'm very worried about it feeding directly into the self-centered habits of American drivers buying bigger and bigger vehicles solely for their own 'protection' and to the detriment of any other person, animal or vehicle involved in a collision (it will already undoubtedly feed the trend of buying unnecessarily large and dangerous vehicles for the sole purpose of looking cool in suburban shopping centers). Hopefully this doesn't influence other automakers' design trends, but it's a Tesla so unfortunately that will likely be the case."

Not everybody is rolling 3+ deep to warrant such a large cab/ back seat in their truck.  A smaller version with just a 40/20/40 front bench would make for a cool alternative especially if it‚Äôs really quick.

I just found out a man in my neighborhood has a Cybertruck. My mother told me there was one here after I told her about the crybertrucks and I didn't believe her. She sent a picture of the truck and the house. I told her that is a cybertruck. He recently got it. She said he is the president of HOA.

@mkbhd Did you dub this video separately? Sometimes the voice and the video are way out of sync!
I'll stick with gas vehicles.  You can drive with all the heads turning.  EVs shouldn't be the future.  EVs are more junk than people think.  Everyone is so caught up with the cool factor.

Infinity is actually the first company to have a sell steer-by-wire in production vehicles in their q50.
The steering is a curse. Cars should feel universal. The moment a cybertruck owner below average smart person needs to drive a friends car  they will crash because they didnt turn enough the steering wheel.
"That the CT will be used primarily on the street makes it being able to stay ahead of a 911 Turbo S to 660' more meaningful. Also, they're going to be releasing a faster one at some point IIRC, not that it's needed,  but fun nevertheless."
"This is the Delorean of our times, Now Only need a New Back in the future movie."
love the documentary like format of the video. maybe the most engaging format in the history of mkbhd . congrats I love it¬†!
that intro was awsome
I think you are right on the nose with the PT Cruiser comparison. I wouldn't be surprised to see it go the same way.
what an intro! wow
Iconic? LOL
"Marques, I think this was the best video you've ever made. And for all the right reasons. It had nothing to do with Tesla and all to do with you and your crew's genius filmmaking ability: everything came together (script, camera work, editing, tempo, delivery, technical due dilligence) in such a near-perfect way that surely makes this video iconic, and uncontroversially so. It's a bold claim, but I've been a fan of you for enough years to feel confident to say that. So, really, huge props to you.

And, now, addressing the discussion you proposed about the ""iconicity"" of the Cybertruck (and of cars in general) at the last portion of the video, I'll say that I agree that the Cybertruck is already an iconic car, but I don't think that it being mass-produced is gonna make it any less iconic, necessarily. I avow to that because I come from a country, Brazil, in which two of the most iconic cars to the general public were also the most popular vehicles on the streets for a very long time. Those were the VW Beetle and VW Kombi (Station Wagon). Now, of course, that logic, as you suggested, might be very different when it comes to the US, and I'm not knowledgeable enough in US popular culture to know if there may be any iconic mass-produced cars there, as there are here in Brazil. However, I put this perspective forward because I truly think that the Cybertruck might as well be forever iconic, no matter how many units end up being produced. Maybe, like in Brazil (and, potentially, like in other places around the world), it being mass produced might make it even more iconic over time!

Aaaaaand that's about it. Again, I'm overjoyed to have seen you've produced such a masterpiece. You deserve it so much, you're constantly improving in your craft. It's always a pleasure watching you, but this one was special. It's a cause for celebration for MKBHD fans that, for its part, must never be underrated. Cheers!"
Brilliant üëèüëèüëè
sick vid
Stayed for how well this was edited. My God.
"How many more videos are you going to make about this truck?  It's definitely been more than 3 now, and just feels like you're shilling this too much not to be sponsored."
Probably the worst looking car ever made.

"I think the arc for the design of cybertruck can be like the iPhones. The first iPhone also had an iconic design, and it was mass produced. People used to wait in lines to get that. Maybe a car and a phone cannot be comparable, but maybe we can draw some analogy here."
"Keep talking about the Cybertruck, Marques, I'll never get tired."
I really would've liked for you to talk about the rust issue!
I thought bro was gonna pull out a sticküòÇ 6:46
What the fuck that visual intro of the edges and 3D Tesla is just nutsü´®üëèüëè
Dude the number of unskippable ads is insane
"I just absolutely love that Tesla is not afraid to bring something radical and different to the market. They could have easily gone with a tried and true truck design, but they didn't. And instead, they were able to make a radical, polarizing, work of art that also happens to be incredibly functional and innovative. Impressive!"
brilliant as usual.

21:00 Yaw is left and right. Pitch is up and down.
The Cybertruck is the MineCraft version of the 1st Gen Honda Ridgeline.
"Steer by wire is the weirdest thing ever. What happens when the battery dies? I have had to push my car with a dead battery once in my life but if I couldn't steer it, I would have needed a tow truck just to move the car so I could replace the battery. Maybe mobile jump packs replace the need now a days but for a vehicle that is supposed to do more than highway driving it seems risky."
It is an awful vehicle
That intro was üî•
"Lol it‚Äôs so funny reading these comments because I guess most ppl in here are real car ppl/fans so I get it. But fr a lot of Tesla‚Äôs calling card is almost like Kanye with his ideas of everybody having new high end shit and that be the standard. Because if the CT gets mass produced & regular ppl can buy one & have it. I dont know I don‚Äôt see a problem with that at all. 

Because that‚Äôs how pushing shit forward looks. Like hate to break it to ppl but we really in 2024. This is the future & we have the power + tech to make some of these things come alive in full force.

IMO, in my opinion that shit is special to see & be alive for.

IMO."
"Iconic pile of shit.  All of the talk I see about it is the rust, panel gaps, engineering flaws, and the fact that it can get stuck in snow that a mid-size car could power its way through."
Would have looked great if had hexagonal wheels.
I'm the opposite of most people. Hated it at first and love it now.
The most dangerous thing about any Tesla is its ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù and their mentality. People reacting to it? I have no idea why - it‚Äôs an awful shape on wheels giving away a cheap movie prop vibes.  Granted it‚Äôs unique and fresh but that‚Äôs about it and the more of them are on the road the more unlike able it will become. Every time I see one I think the good and nice design is gone in this world.
This car will never be allowed in europe. Its cutting someone in half with a razorblade when you hit someone. Just in the stupid us something dangerous like this is legal
Secondly y u thunk i care about how fast it is ....this thing about fast vehicles is dumb ...unless i want to commit some kind of crime ...i dont need a fast truck i need a powerful one
Thumbs down = middle finger
This car also doesn‚Äôt have auto cruise control which is HUGE!
"Most people calling it hideous online want this truck to fail and hate Elon. Most people in real life, love Elon and love the Cybertruck. Narrative building online because it's the car industry."
"It's just typical Tesla jank. Bad build quality, bad software, not working assistance systems and the most horrible body part spacing a European can encounter... And yes, it's ugly as shit."
It's where the most horrible things I've ever seen. I was in LA this weekend and saw 5 of them and every time I saw it I literally wanted to heave. If you want to say it's something different fine that it is. Iconic that's a bit of a stretch. The risk of making it was iconic if that makes sense. It's like being in a bad marriage if you're not in love what's the point.
Oh its a eye turner ..but dont confuse hype with person wanted this vehicle .....its a buzz like vision 6 months noone is gonna care
"Iconic doesn't have to be rare or short live, for example classic mini was made from 1959 to 2000 with more than 5M produced, still one of the most iconic car on the road today"
It's ugly not just because of how it looks but the size of it. It's unnecessarily obnoxiously big.
Good working mentioning Miles and glad your both part of the same team
Y only black people in the video mr.racist
I saw one a guy has one and his kid goes to my school
"i`m getting TopGear vibes. Keep it up, such quality content."
I would literally watch a series with Marques and the the OG Top Gear trio over and over. I get that he‚Äôs reviewing the CT because of the tech but Richard Jeremy and James doing a show with Marques ticks  my instant iconic checklist
Tesla stock needs a push and Pal MKB is glad to help out
The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is anyone trying to use it like an actual truck. I've seen more wrecked and destroyed Cybertrucks in the little time that its been out than any other truck on the market.
Its not stock üëäüèΩüòÇ
Personally - do not want. It's huge and ugly - not to mention I'd have no way to charge it.
It looks like AJ Hawk if he was an electric vehicle
‚ÄúLook at all these people pointing and laughing! I‚Äôm iconic!‚Äù

"As a bicycle commuter and pedestrian, I strongly dislike where car culture is trending. It's scary when 80% of people get joy out of seeing a behemoth that can splatter me across the pavement from 60 feet across the road in 1.638 seconds. The bigger gas/diesel trucks and SUVs are already scary, but these new electric trucks are next level."
Its ugly!!! I also believe its a dangerous vehicle. People have to look down at the screen to reverse and those triangle mirrors?
I think you are right‚Ä¶. Whenever you have a vehicle that has a cool design and it‚Äôs affordable‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs only ICONIC for a short time‚Ä¶ then it is just another Vehicle!
Cybertruck is ugly AF
Im going to tell Jason at EE that you got a white board while talking about cars‚Ä¶.

Anyone not think this is just a large deloren? Install a flux capacitor ...

Front of the truck looks like Ironman‚Äôs face‚Ä¶
Loving this quality. Keep that up Marques!
That truck makes me feel like I'm in Minecraft. It's so ugly...
Lexus actually had a full steer by wire first.
Bulletproof panels? Probably need it only in US
There are many examples of iconic designs that have entered the mass market. Think the original Mini and the 1st generation revamp. Fiat 500 and its revamp. Original Land Rover Defender. To a degree even the Jeep Wrangler. Definitely Golf 1. CT might just be like one of those icons in 20 years.
Was this video paid for? Absolutely ugly truck.
"If someone gave me this truck for free.....I would walk a million miles, barefoot, on razor blades just to use the restroom.
Just cannot find any redeeming, truly, real world, practical qualities.

The real test will be the two year, five year, ten year review.
I'm an idiot.
Why would I believe that this thing will still be any thing other than a conversation piece in ten years.

There is also a coldness about it's design that sums up our society these days.
In contrast consider the lines of a 57' Chevy Belair.
Pure style, Pure heart and all human created.
Still an icon in 2024.

I know it is a car and apples to apples and does not seem to be a fair comparison.
It is fair when you struggle to find one ounce of character in this thing tesla created and yes...lower case t on purpose.


Love your channel and content.
Just cannot wrap my heart around this thing.ü•∂

OK Marques pulling out the Engineering Explained white board lol

It's the biggest design change in 30 years.  And it's dope.  I really really want one
Definitely not enough tesla hate to be a real review
What is the target audience for this channel at this point? Is it just pure entertainment with MAYBE some factual information? As a consumer goods reviewer you neglected to call out Tesla for very blatantly lying in one of their advertisements regarding the quarter mile race.
What lens did you use in the warehouse? I thought that it might be anamorphic because of the sweet lens flairs... but the bokeh is too round. The flairs were added... am I right?
So many jealous people
When Marques starts fanboying over Tesla he becomes unbearable. Doesn't help that you have a personal relationship with Elon. If this was actual journalism and not entertainment it would be completely unethical.
"13:20 that is NOT fine.  People aren't getting into a cyber truck from other trucks.  they're getting into one from a model 3 or similar sized car.  meaning the roads (which are already in a terrible, deteriorated condition) are going to have to cope with millions of tons more vehicle weight driving on them.  not to mention any of the pedestrian safety concerns..."
This was a brilliant orgasmic Videography. Everything was on point. MKBHD is surely on another level.
Cybertrucks biggest flaw is being affiliate with Elon Musk
You need to step out of that Porsche and get any real exotic. Same shit.

It's striking without being good-looking. It has presence. Striking doesn't have to be attractive; can also be sexy-ugly eg Kramer.
"IMHO: That thing is fugly......And good luck
re-charging it in the desert."
Iconic doesn't mean rare.
It's sacrificing the lot of other things to be different and being an iconic doesn't mean the market will welcome it. Can't wait to see what next... üôÑ

"That was a ridiculously good video. (also, water is wet, yeah, I know...these guys are just that good, what can you do?)"
Hear me out. Cybertruck‚Ä¶. As a camera car
"Went to see a PT Cruiser at a dealership with my family when it was just released. While in the back, a dealer walked up with another potential buyer and said, ‚ÄúOk guys‚Ä¶times up.‚Äù I can honestly say that I‚Äôve never wanted to see a car fail more than the PT Cruiser. So I guess the lesson for Tesla (or any other car company) is to treat your customers right, or end up like Chrysler."

"Another feature Tesla Cybertruck MUST HAVE as an option are TWEEL airless tires/wheels which are one of the best options for making sure BOTH on-raod and off-road driving will not have your day ruined when you drive over a super-sharp rock or piece of glass or nails!  Tesla ALSO NEEDS to look at DARPA SHAPE SHIFTING WHEELS (i.e. look up both TWEEL and SHAPE SHIFTING WHEELS on Youtube and Google!) which lets you change the shape of your wheel from fully round to triangular tractor tread at the touch of a button so that Summer and Winter driving can be optimized depending on how snow, icy, sandy, rocky or wet the road conditions are! It also means you could go up the gnarliest and steepest off-road trails in Tractor Tread mode and then go back into Round Wheel fast highway driving at the mere touch of an in-cabin touchscreen button!

Look then up!  TWEEL and DARPA SHAPE SHIFTING WHEELS

Do you get feedback from the road through the steering wheel? Most noticeably it would occur driving over speed bumps or pot holes.
"This is when someone loses sight of what a good product actually is. Tesla cars are filled w/ multiple useability flaws. It's like defending poorly designed Apple products. I'm sorry, but bad is just bad. If Tesla can fix flaws and eventually mass produce, good on them. But w/ the trend of Tesla putting up a dog and pony show and wowing the world and investors, then under delivering, I don't see them dominating the market in the future. That is, unless, Elon steps away from meddling w/ technical staff decisions. You gain success from letting your best people do their work."
"Dont know man, this review is a little funny to me. I am upfront i am no musk fan so more than likely to look at this negative bias. Still, a couple of concerns stuck out to me:

1) the issue with the car door: i accept initial production and such there are teething pain but why tape fix? Is there an issue taking it to service to fix? Why only a comment on twitter about it? 
2) the race, i am sorry, what tesla is doin is deceiving pure and simple. Most basic 911, not even the full race shown, selective data of the full race afterwards with no comparisons.
3) you claim on hand it is a regular tesla under the truck guise, yet you admit it lacks a few  the same features so it isnt a full tesla under there. Why arent the same features available? Was it rushed out? Shouldnt it be feature complere even if it is early models?Should it be the same under the hood? Domt trucks have specific needs that cars dont need different software and such?
4) you seem to gloss over issues like towing and the matter of the missing features due people having other priorities. However what about the people that it is a priority, what id you need the features when you did not think you need it? Even if it is not a priority why settle for lesser when others have it better or as standard?
5) the lack of handles. Wasnt there an issue with the door being frozen shut in cold weather? Was that resovled? How do you access the car otherwise?
6) no physical controls or buttons/all controls in one screen- what do you do if that tablet is broken or doesnt fuction properly? How many features or functions do you lose? Can you drive without it both physically and without readouts like a speedometer? 
I am trying to keep an open mind about this so if there are reasonable answers i am happy to here them."
"When the CT rolled on stage for the World to see, l said to myself _""l'm A Believer""_ and l knew there and then that it was an instant _CLASSIC_"

It carries 2500 lbs in the bed which 300 lbs for than a typical Ford F150 Truck. It can two 11,000 lbs which is one thousand pounds MORE than the F150 Lightning!  The audio system IS ASTOUNDING in its audio-purist-laden sound quality! The inside is minimalist and simple, allowing for easy cleaning!

EVERYTHING about this truck screams both PURE TRUCK ABILITY and pure awesomeness!

This is just the START of good thinks to come into the Tesla Cybertruck world! Wait until Tesla puts in the massaging seats, the built-in combo-fridge/freezer, the built-in Nespresso coffee maker and the built-in combo-microwave/convection oven AND add the 100,000 lumens lightbar and 360-degree surround-view FLIR thermal nightvision system!  It will be a monster of pure truck luxury and towing/carrying ability!

This truck GROWS on you the more you drive it and more you use it AS an actual truck (i.e. carry and tow stuff!).

In five years we won't be having this type of conversation anymore. It will instead be: Can hit 1500 miles range on a single charge? and Can other truck companies compete with it in the market place?

The Cybertruck is A LOT BETTER THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE! No other vehicle has hit more home runs right out of the starting gate than any other vehicle.  The driving range issue will be SOLVED within two years! The Self-driving software WILL be coming by 2025! All the other 3rd party add-ons and extras will ALSO be coming down the pipeline as we speak! Look already how many AWESOME Vinyl Wraps we can get for the Cybertruck! Matte, Glossy, Full Colour Images, Cammo Patterns and even the colour changing ones you see on modern phone cases! It's GREAT!

Keep Going Tesla! This is a WINNING PRODUCT and just needs more factory support and driving range increases!

"it's the most hideous, overhyped, overpriced and dangerous thing on the road today"
"MKBHD, I think Its now time to review some BYD Cars and Xiaomi Suv7."
"Thanks for explaining the basic physics about racing! that video  to me is very disgusting. 

Basically a cheap shot against Porsche. Like you said, that‚Äôs a base 911 , Tesla is fooling people who know nothing about cars and races. 

Also only boy wannabe racers cares only about straight line performance. Anyone who‚Äôs into cars knows 911 doesn‚Äôt have the biggest horsepower figure, even among gas cars. the essence of a 911 is within the handling and track performance. 

End of the day, it‚Äôs two very different group who are buying these two cars, there is no point comparing them to begin with. People who want a truck won‚Äôt even buy a Toyota GR 86, not to mention a 911. It‚Äôs just not their life style"

Tell that to the guy withe the two broken legs who has hit by sedan.
No fucking crumple zones, that energy needs to be absorbed by something guys."
More of that 911 please üòç
"I like this truck. It's such a paradigm shift from the ordinary that people can't process the boldness.  Will this vehicle still look good (my opinion) in 10 years time?  I think so.  If this was in a Batman movie, people would be paying admission to see it."

"We live in an amazing time: rockets look like they did in 60‚Äôs sci-fi, and cars look like the ones I drew in grade school. Old is the new new."
"Is not a good vehicle at all, but it does looks futuristic ngl."
"I feel like the rear wheel steering isn't on other trucks because the towing is best on a solid axle. When you put the steering knuckles on the end, you introduce a weak point or potential failure point under load. I do agree most folks don't tow as often or as much as they think when they buy a truck and how it impacts battery mileage is enough to keep it from really being much of an issue with this vehicle."

Easily one of my favorite videos I‚Äôve seen on the channel. Really enjoyed this one. üî•
Yall definitely need a ‚ÄúMKBTS‚Äù channel. Not quite like the studio but just solely behind the scenes content of main channel vids.
Tesla could release a cyber punk looking pile of literal dog shit and this dude would glaze up and down on it
"9:14 if you believe that only 15 trucks had that issue, it's sad to see how much of the Kool-Aid you've drank @MKBHD"
Re drag race: shut up Marquees
You can really tell a lot of time and thought went into this review. High production value. Thanks Marques for always delivering.
"The PT cruiser was a PTOS, that's why everyone ended up hating it. 
The Cyber truck is awesome, that's why people will continue to love it."
Waiting for Xiaomi 14 Ultra camera review from MKBHD.
"Quality video production, I must give it to you üëèüèº."
"As someone who drives a truck, I've only towed something once. Why? It's a base line 2005 ford ranger. It can barely make it up a highway hill at highway speed XD. If I tried towing anything more than a lawnmower, I'd be at a stalemate. But I can lug full sized plywood just fine"
"I don‚Äôt know which tach YouTuber puts in this much work in a video.  Drop your pitch forks, take a look around his peers. You‚Äôre welcome!"
"I think there's an 80/20 chance of this truck working out and kinda become a thing, ppl finding more and more use for it. Not unlike the VW bug or VW bus during their launch time that's my best guess."
"I love that thing, I‚Äôll never own it but it‚Äôs still bitchin!"
Very nice!
LUL Scheduling a tesla service appointment to tighten a bolt...
Marques I've been watching your content for a while (before 2016) and I'm concerned with your tendency to support Elon Musk and his products. I know I may be in the minority in believing this but genuinely seeing you review his products is something that personally is putting me off watching your channel and making me consider unsubscribing. I cannot support Elon Musk and his right wing agenda he pushes that spreads hate and consequently kills people. The normalisation of his name and products allows him to stay relevant and continue in pushing his hate fuelled agenda. Please stop reviewing his products and mentioning his name.
The truck is gunna be cheap as hell in a few years after they catch up to demand.
Can you tell Marques has been getting into F1 recently?

Lexus and Toyota had steer-by-wire vehicles out first off the top of my head.
If I was buying a truck for towing I would not buy an F-150. At minimum I would want an F-250.
13:09 Eventually this truck will be cheap enough to be a huge success in third world countries. Tesla is really making a difference in the evolution to sustainable energy. Because cheap small electric cars are stupid. Make giant electric and super expensive tanks if you want to make the world a better place üéâ
VW Bug is iconic and was mass produced
The hell you wearing two hoodies for MKBHD
"I had this reactions with my Mach-E 3 years ago. I was one of the first in my country to get one. The first year i got questions like is it a Ferrari, is it a Lambo, what kind of car is that, pics taken, thumbs up, people moving out of the way etc.... The Cybertruck is next level that, we are entering a new era of cars since the normalization of electric cars."
This truck is everything that is wrong with the world
Do people like it because it‚Äôs different and rare on the streets now OR for anything else.
The PT Cruiser had more personality than the Cyber Truck.
2:39 this mock-up actually looks really nice!
This is the first video of this channel I've seen. Well done! I enjoy your presentation style and your honesty.
"Absolutely love this truck. I don‚Äôt tow an RV or boat across the country so this thing is going to be epic. I‚Äôve owned 4 F150s, one square body chev, and numerous other off-road vehicles and this unit is going to be a riot."
6:44 i thought homie was gonna pull out a glock
"I saw 2 Cyber Trucks over a month ago at a shopping plaza in an affluent part of town. Needless to say, no one walked by either of them without stopping to look and/or take pictures. Like it or not, this vehicle definitely turns heads and gathers attentions."
"If most people don't need a truck, we shouldn't be encouraging them to buy them. Trucks are inefficient and dangerous, even the electric ones."
That's to early to call it iconic. It hasn't proven its worth outside of the usa
PT Cruiser caught some strays
there goes the 37% again(percentage of people actually towing with trucks) @Veritasiam
Dawg nothing Elon or Tesla does is iconic...  ever.
"Over here to have a look at the take of MB on Cybertruck, just stupid but hope you got you LFT checked man, your palms looking kinda yellowish. Love all your videos By the way,"
"I believe that steer by wire was a feature scheduled for S plaid, but got delayed to CT. That would explain the yoke."
"What most people miss: there is zero chance people outside the US will buy this. This is a niche car for one market only. 
Imagine driven a car likes this in Europe, Japan, China or anywhere in South America: no chance the authorities will even allow this on the road. And it would be sooo impractical.

Ah: it might sell well in Saudi or Qatar"
"I watch all your videos, but this is one of your least honest videos Are you doing this as a friendship gesture for Elon, why you did not discuss safety issues etc"
Really pushing an epstein friend's product. Sad

"MKBHD if you wanted to put this level of production in the autofocus channel, it would become the #1 car review channel on youtube - your heard it here first... thanks for the video"
I'll bet that cold rolled steel would be hotter than Hell and blinding in the Arizona sun where I live.
What an intro!!!
"stop ignoring how dangerous these ""cars"" are for everyone not inside it."
And it is definitely not a truck
Could also be people are hyped to see MKBHD in person ü´°

"The PT Cruiser is an objectively ugly car. If there were 1 million Lamborghini Countach‚Äôs driving around and I was seeing five or even 10 every day I would say to myself ‚Äúthat is a beautiful car‚Äú and I would say that 5 or 10 times a day. It wouldnt change the fact that it is beautiful. No, the Cybertruck isn‚Äôt as good looking as a Countach but it is still better looking than the PT cruiser and I think it will become like a model 3 (which looks like a Porsche from some angles - and again, quite good looking) where it is great to look at and you see it from different angles and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs nice‚Äù but it becomes more of a normal kind of observation but it‚Äôll be a good looking car no less, that you see quite often. Good on Tesla for stepping out on this one."
Already a rustable unsafe sharp edge untested lazy car? Yes!
It is a designers enema
Nice review. You can use some stainless steel polish/sealant that can help protect the metal and clean stains
You‚Äôre starting to give secret society member vibes
"16:00-19:43 cute to see how Marques starts to explain how length of race matters over performance, yes Porsche wins, yes duration matters. Yes."
"1st year it's out. If it's trulyass produced it'll wear off and it'll be normal. Unless it's as limited to something like Vipers were, the crowd appeal will wear off. 

I do love the way it looks though. It's beautiful üòç"
"Personally, I think it‚Äôs atrocious and design offensive."
Why doesn't anyone talk with the firefighters that might need to get you out of this car and how would they do that? what happens in case of an accident? What if you faint int he car and police or other good people cannot get you out of the car because there is no handle or it has bullet proof windows? I feel that all reviews for these electric cars don't touch at all on the dangers or the problems with various features.
"Did u say ""My Child"" meaning the CyberTrash? Dude u need to chill, i know Elon put money in your throut to say all that crap but .... just chill, nobody cares exept USA about something (THIS THING IS NOT A CAR) that last max 5 years. About the price: wow its sooo cheap 4-5 years (minus) -100K, for that amount every car will last decades!"
"I've already seen these things a few times around LA.

The first time was like, ""Huh!""

I''m already getting to ""Huh."""
"That's one ugly car, but I am getting one in couple of years when I get my next car. Just waiting on Tesla to start mass producing those so is easier to get and also start seeing them on the road on regular basis so I don't stand out and get attention."
"I can totally understand that biker, getting hit by a Cybertruck and it's really hard body (and extremely sharp edges) will be even more deadly than a normal truck. Even getting hit by it in a normal car will be more dangerous since the smaller car will have to absorb even more of the speed. How is this thing even legal?"
Afaik this will never come to Europe and I hope it will stay that way

"It can still be iconic and mass produced, like the old vw vans"
"people not knowing about the cybertruck isnt actually that shocking to me. its a niche car. Surprisingly enough, most people dont even know much about specific tesla cars and that even big brands such as Nissan and Mercedes have even started making EVs."
Perfect vehicle in a ZOMBIE apocalypse üòÇ for HIT & RUN
"What I feel you completly missed the concept of crumble zones, which is really important for safety."
Like air Jordan‚Äôs or Yeezys everyone got them
"When there are many of these 7000lb moving bulletproof, blinding, razorblades on the road, I don't see how you can possibly say that that isn't the most dangerous thing about the truck. Sports cars that can move that fast can also stop very fast. Stopping 7,000 lbs quickly is just not happening. I've seen the braking tests. So yeah, this is the family guy episode... ""Good luck everyone else!"""
"As it pertains to the Cybertruck's looks:

It's _so ugly._

I love it."
The thing looks like the cars I used to draw in Kindergarten in 1988 had a love child with a Fridgidaire Stainless Steel French Door Fridge that someone left on the side of the road.
Getting rid of physical buttons and sticks was a terrible idea.  Why didn't tesla learn the lesson from the Macbook touchbar debacle?
"has got to be one of the ugliest vehicles ever made in history. We get it Marques, you have a lot of money."
"Ok, PT Cruiser was never cool. It was at best odd. Now it just looks silly. Cybertruck is completely unique. Design wise it can be called cool. You don't have to like it but you should recognize it's iconic look and I think it's going to set a new trend in the future. I prefer V8/V10 coupes as a perfect vehicles but I can command Tesla for the bold move into something completely different in this category. I think it's the best kind of design (shape wise) for the super quick, futuristic, electric truck. V2 or V3 is going to be great I bet."
That car is too massive and can cause a lot of tragedy on the roads.
So many people have backed into me while parked.. leaving marks from their trailer hooks.. I want something that can take that but does not rust when sitting in the rain üòÖ
"Very interesting video, thank you very much!"
Best reviewer üòä
"This is a paid ad, not a review. MKBHD is a Tesla fanboy."
If it become iconic i hope the reason will be because it is a good vehicle and not just a marketing marvel.
No hover conversion. I'm out.
Maybe all those people on the road and pedestrians are like ‚ÄúOh snap it‚Äôs Marques!!‚Äú
why have a seperate car review channel if youre gonna upload it in the main chan
It will be good and somewhat easy to make this car fully armoured ..
Cybertruck <--->cartoon truck üòÇüòÖ
I would rather have a rusted out 1989 Lada Riva than this.  Awful.
"I use the bed of my truck.  I‚Äôm curious about the bed, covering, tailgate etc.,  perhaps your other videos"
Honestly love its design
"Is the Cybertruck an iconic design?

A: widely recognized and well-established an iconic brand name
B: widely known and acknowledged especially for distinctive excellence

Well, it‚Äôs weird and distinctive, but it‚Äôs certainly not in the category of ‚Äúdesign excellence‚Äù, in that it‚Äôs a beautiful design. I‚Äôll certainly acknowledge that it‚Äôs already iconic in the same way that a Gremlin or Aztecs is though."
"The word you're looking for is ""embarrassing."""
Once the novelty is gone; this is going to simply be a bad design
One second mistake 18:04 from 1.6 to 2.6 s?
"Iconic for looking like a car from a 70s video game? Iconic for its spartan dashboard with a tablet slapped on it? Iconic with respect to being the first car in the 21st century you need to pay extra to have it painted by the manufacturer? Iconic for developing rust in a matter of months, otherwise? Iconic for not actually being bulletproof, but some people telling the world it is? The thing with influencing is that at a certain point people can tell when you're paid to give an opinion.

How"
Cyber novelty urinal. Hideous.
Fake news
A Porsche 911 is iconic. The Cybertruck is notorious for being an overpriced piece of ... [fill in the blank]
"I don't even care how it looks, I'm just obsessed with that studio space you have to show the car off."
"I don't know about the Cybertruck being iconic it's just cool for now but the quality of this video , now that's iconic üôå you really are 99 bro"
I wonder if the variable steering ratio makes it difficult to ‚Äúget used to‚Äù driving.
What an intreating sports shirt you are wearing while talking about drag strip numbers...
"It's so ugly, that it comes full circle and is now cool"
At 6.52 I thought you were going to pull out a gun.
your content is ad for tesla. you should do better.
"It is not one of those overlaid fake ones, right?"
music this episode is SICK
madlad Marques racing his 911 with his CyberBeast on a drag strip. That's new! Didn't see any other youtuber racing with 911 yet. I had seen the Engineering Explained debunk video of Tesla's race when it was released.
"The mix of tech, cars, and engineering in the video is what I love"
"""my child"" ü§≠ü§≠"
God that thing looks so awful.
Already iconic? NO.  Its just another EV...there i simply nothing special about this car if you strip it of its tech and gadgets.
"Heavy, super hard metal, sharp angles. I'm really wondering what this biker might not like about seeing it on the road..."
Im waiting for people to paint and customise it
"I drove one here in Mi... I dont hear anyone talk about how small the space inside feels. This is not for the general people... this is a collector¬¥s item. It is a technology prototype, I do seee some of these technologies making it to the general public, under 50K"
"Very informative, thank you!"
An iconic joke
"My first car was a PT Cruiser, I cannot imagine a time existed where anyone thought that was a cool car üòÖ"
so the 5 mins fix for door gap is ductaps ok
11:21 In another video you pronounced h in honest. Now you didn't. Yes!
"This video is a master piece of production, narration - and diplomacy. You can't hype the cyber truck too much because you'd be hyping the product of one of the most outstandable billionaire j***ks in history - but you can't either destroy it because this is a valuable business connection. Respect for still being able to put a lot of honesty in it - and for that awesome race  üèéüèé"
how much do they pay you?
Did not expect that you would not go into safety. The biker gave you the thumbs down because it is a super unsafe car for pedestrians
"Production quality, production quality, production quality!!! This video is next level. Was there a dedicated DP on this shoot?"
It looks like a car from the 1980s sci-fi imagination of how future cars would look
"It gives me so much joy seeing Marques driving the truck around the streets of Jersey City where I live rn, big up JC!"
"Brilliant video Marques. That shot at the end with the front/seat/rear, perfection."
"Damn that 911 Explanation seems personal ü§£ü§£, its not that deep"
"DeLorean was like a movie prop, looked cool, aged well, and now a symbol of its time, though, of course, outdated by this time.

The cybertruck is already outdated."
Yo me espero asta la nueva generaci√≥n.. por que este modelo solo es un experimento!!
15:14 GERMANY !!!
"It‚Äôs iconic and so are mustangs and beetles. 

I‚Äôve seen 1000 rivians on the road and I still like them. 

I‚Äôm a truck owner (2 time) and I‚Äôm excited to get mine. I‚Äôve towed and I haul. Never super heavy or longer distances. Electric will take some getting used to, but it‚Äôs an exciting vehicle for sure!"
Marquess wearing a German Trikot ;)
"The Cybertruck reminds me of decades of French car design.  They often came out with very quirky, radical looking vehicles, and were sold on that novelty, which would last for a few years.  If you see these vehicles a decade or two later, you realise just how bad-looking they really are.  The Cybertruck falls into the same category for me, with the exception that, unlike the PT Cruiser which was at least priced within the realms of possibility that someone could afford it, the Cybertruck was released at a much higher price-point than originally promised.  It will always be a rarity, until Tesla build a better, cheaper model in a few years time.  Hell, they might not even bother.  This vehicle is a marketing exercise packaged as a truck, intended to garner fame, notoriety and admiration, and in that respect, it has been a success.  If you really want to drive an iconic truck, get yourself a Toyota Landcruiser."

Tesla Cybertruck wants to be a truck but isn‚Äôt
I'm more interested in the Xiaomi SU7 review.
Most dangerous thing is a guy doing another video on the CT for $ after he knows the CT factory is racist. So racist he sold his CT.
"I saw my first cyber truck yesterday, just in passing, here in New Jersey.  It‚Äôs legitimately shocking.   I am a jeep wrangler guy with peace and love‚Ä¶. But it‚Äôs really cool looking in person."
"as someone who prefers to commute on a motorcycle, the turning radius on this thing combined with the weight, acceleration, & fly by wire steering, really makes me wonder, if this is the direction their design is going, should i consider moving somewhere tesla won't ever deliver to? 

bc tbh, this is just a frightening direction that i hope does not catch on to much larger trucks, or even a nightmare XL version of this heavy monster."
"Can I have my cyber truck in matte red?, ‚úã.

Well.., I'll be a monkey's uncle. üòπ"
"I think it's super cool, and it's neat that it exists. But for practicality, I'd choose a Rivian or Lightning over this, probably."
My advice? Watch the Adam Something piece on the cyber truck.
Yeah... nothing a biker has to say will effect my life decisions ü§£ü§£
"My favorite type of car is italian sport cars. I will never buy anything from Tesla, but whatever gives more publicity to electric cars is good enough."
"honestly, as a scooter rider, i genuinely hope i'll never encounter one of these on the road. looks terrifying on the outside."
Get prepared for the first drive by in a cyber truck
I don‚Äôt understand why Marques is still hyping Tesla given how horrible Elon has turned out to be.
So Tesla Cybertruck is basically Apple EV car we were been waiting for :D Or is it? (Xiaomi EV knock knock...)
"With a family, I'll go with a Lucid Gravity."
"Great video. I'll chime in and say I bet not all thumbs downs you're getting are because of the design. I'm sure many are just because it's a Tesla and it's Musk. I hate the man and wouldn't buy one (or even ride in one) of his vehicles and I generally think less of anyone who does. The design of the vehicle itself isn't really relevant. I know there are plenty of people who'll think I'm stupid for thinking this way, but it's more a gut reaction than a thought process. Musk (and Trump and Putin and MTG and countless others) make the world a worse place every day. Financially supporting them seems pretty thoughtless and selfish. That's worth a thumbs-down in my book."
Minority report kinda ugly and dystopic.
"iconic because of how lame it is, sure."
Let's just call the drag race what it was... deceiving.
Cool technology under that ugly truck.
Marques losing all his credibility for being an Elon apologist. This car is a disaster and should not be sold.
"NICE review man, lots of great insights and information. Just wanna give you a thumbs up!"
this is a perfect design for a pedestrians destroyer.
"The closest comparison for me is the Delorean. Especially with the design and colors. It‚Äôs iconic, divisive, and a questionable buy."
Besides it looking like crap .
Ignoring safety concerns  altogether is a bit asinine or convenient. Maybe both. Surely it's disappointing.
I think the PT Cruiser comparison is spot on !
"No of course not.  Unless you don‚Äôt know what iconic means.  We throw around iconic, legend, etc so much that they don‚Äôt mean anything anymore.  The hype here is because of ridiculous it looks."
20k extra for FSD and extra stuff... but FSD isn't even available for the CT yet.. so prepay 12k.. crazy
"You hace been my favorite reviewer for a while. But this is not a review. At all. This is exactly the same as thoughts on videos u do.
Disappointing 30 mins."
Playstation 1 graphics
Comparing a Cybertruck to a PT Cruiser is hilarious üòÇ Elon‚Äôs punching the air after that one
"Elon is only human, and just couldn't resist pandering to the American obsession with larger and larger lifestyle vehicles, especially after seeing what Franz could offer. I can't blame him, love the design and engineering. But taking a multi-ton vehicle to fetch groceries, do the school run, get to work?
When 60% of trips are less than 6 miles, 95% less than 31,  please don't talk about accelerating the mission to sustainable energy. It's about as useful as putting more lanes in tunnels.
And for 330m people to create more CO2 than the billions of China and India combined isn't a great look."
The intro music ‚ù§
"the accidents that will ensue from this vehicle will be brutal. yes, not for the driver but i will remain as far from the big inefficient truck and the ego driven truck drivers as possible. all 63%"
"Marques brownlee , how many Tesla Cyber trucks are they currently?"
Great timing and quality vid
No.
"I enjoyed watching this,  greetings from 'The Betterlands'  ...  also know as 'The Netherlands!  ...thx M8  ¬∂ ; - )"
I'd rather drive the Fiat Multipla than this piece of garbage.
"Yeah it‚Äôs iconic, it‚Äôs strange, it‚Äôs attention grabbing. Doesn‚Äôt mean I would ever want one. I still don‚Äôt think it could pass most developed countries safety regulations. But Tesla‚Äôs minimalist attitude has ruined car design, removing buttons and integrating everything is stupid. We all know electric products fail if the screen fails you loose everything."
Cybertruck is a win in my book cause I‚Äôm sick of seeing a boring sea of black and white SUVs. Bring back funky cars
"It's a novelty garbage for wealthy people. The stranger and flashier the better, so I guess it did it's job in that regard. If you somehow legally drive a tank on the streets you will also have a lot of looks your way ;p ."

"Jesus is God's Son.  Jesus was born by the virgin Mary who conceived by God.  Jesus never sinned.  Jesus was crucified and died for the sins of the world.  Jesus's Blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins.  Jesus was entombed for thee days.  Jesus was raised from the dead by God..  Jesus left the tomb.  Jesus was seen, heard and touched by witnesses who said Jesus is alive.  Jesus ascended to heaven and sat down at the right hand of the father.  Jesus will return to the earth.  Jesus is Lord.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God has raised Him from the dead you shall be saved.  Any one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, that any one who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.  Jesus said, ""No greater love has one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.""  If we confess our sins God is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
I think this guy is paid by tesla to hype the cybertruck

"Ionic, instantly recognizable, and mass produced - *Mustang*

I was really lucky back in early 2005 to get one of the first few black S197 mustangs around Philadelphia.  I was commuting from South Jersey at the time, and for about those first 6 months it got a TON of attention.  I only ever recall seeing another pale green S197 until production caught up.  Now, they are everywhere.  But still Iconic.

(I do have a CT reservation in, and could have got mine last year.  BUT, I reserved the base RWD model in 2019 and I'm sticking to it.  IF it can still be had for +/-50K, I still think it will be the best new car value for a Jack-of-all trades daily driver out there.)"
"I don't care about the CyberTruck, but I love the intro to this video. Always appreciate the time put in on the video production."
"Great video, just a tad drawn out a bit too much. Would have liked to see it about 5mins + shorter"
I believe there was an SUV Lexus that was the first to combine a yoke steering wheel and variable steer by wire. The cybertrucks addition of four-wheel steering is sick tho
Hmmm. That was the least ‚Äúreview‚Äù review I‚Äôve seen if the Cybertruck. No real meaningful conclusions. No talk about safety. The lack of rear view impact on day to day driving. The fact that‚Äôs it‚Äôs iconic/rare now is utterly irrelevant. In two years this nobody will care.
"While I agree that it is already iconic, but iconic can be an dual edge sword.
Iconic:
1. of, relating to, or having the characteristics of an icon
2a. widely recognized and well-established

What is widely recognized and well-established as ugly is the Fiat Multipla.

The cybertruck is bold, I'll give it that. Much better looking than the Multipla"
"You were right. This is one of the finer videos on this channel. The music, the videography, the writing- excellent. Good Job Marques !"
This is a marketing campaign in different  way üòÇ
Owning a Tesla vehicle has surprised me with their reaction and behaviors to it. Some are 50/50 towards a fuel alternative vehicle. Some hate it and some do not. Some hate it because of the CEO. Some hate it because they don't understand the tech. Some hate it because they like gas powered vehicle. To each of their own.
Marques made this summary video probably only for the clicks. üòÇ
iphones are iconic and sht ton of ppl got em... iconic is just iconic.
Great video! Thanks for sharing your opinion and your completely fair conclusion. I think the Cybertruck is a great car with a completely outstanding design. And this is what I totally love about the car. Not the next same-looking car like nearly every other car brand. I hope I will get one soon in Germany! ‚úåÔ∏è
so american
Elons racism and fascism support makes this car trash
I think the blinding glare is probably the most dangerous part. that and the ego of the driver. I think there will be lawsuits about that which will require the whole body to be sanded down or painted with an anti reflective coating. Stainless steel did not work on the delorean and it won't work on the cybertruck. The body shop appraiser is going to be dancing the jig when these start getting dented or wrecked.
Before watching the video I answer Yes. This truck has been iconic way before its launch
Not something to brag about.. it's killing millions of jobs off a fake energy propaganda...
"I love the looks and hate the design. It‚Äôs bulky, too big and unfriendly to pedestrian safety."
I usually really like his content but the bias in this one is crazy. The way he downplays or straight up doesn't even acknowledge certain downsides is pretty gross.
Wheels play a big part and it doesn't work
"""my child"" was crazzyy, marques embracing the memes"
"This car is ugly and dangerous. It shouldn‚Äôt be on any public street and I really hope no other country allows it to be sold. 

Additionally it‚Äòs by a company that is ruining the whole car industry by removing physical buttons and stocks, making way to fast vehicles that are supposed to be efficient and environmentally friendly, and btw is owned by a deeply flawed racist that I really really really goes sued and bankrupt as soon as possible. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I honestly think that EV‚Äòs are the future but I‚Äòd rather see companies like Toyota (with their solid state batteries) or Rivian succeed than this fu**ed up one."

"I have to say, living where I live I will never see a Cybertruck and I really couldnt care less except that I love tech, so when Youtube was literally pushing this down my throat all week I finally gave in and watched, and in usual fashion, Marques Brownlee makes this topic so interesting. Love your angles on things and how well you challenge tech and script your ideas. Nailed it again."
"Tesla's Delorean, in many ways :-)"
"Great video. Loved your commentary at the end! I am old enough to remember the PT Cruiser and what you said was 100 percent accurate. 

People were paying over MSRP to get one. And they‚Äôd even be tricked out with TVs and subs and you‚Äôd see them at car shows. It was wild."
"Saint internet. 

Coolest video yet. Like mkbhd galaxy park meow.üéâüéâüéâ"
Coolest vehicle to hit the road ever!
Something about seeing a cyber truck in a drive through is absolutely hilarious to me.
Early adopter stuff üéâ
4:42 Lexus did it first
actually video changing race scene
"when you are stupid, you attract stupid"
"This car is a joke to the industry. A car built on promises not delivered, a motorized murder machine with no focus on actual usability (small trunk, not even space for a bike), blinding lights, and an exterior design that deteriorates quickly, really? Tesla is better than this c*ap."
"I just saw one in person, and that thing is ugly."
"it's well-engineered but amazingly stupid at the same time, it has so many poor design decisions that it's unlikely to be sold anywhere that has sensible road safety laws. If it's iconic it's like fiat multipla iconic."
Tesla was not the first to do steer by wire
Elon Musk has democratized an Icon.
It's Iconic
"FIY, ""Willing Beta Tester"" is not , and never will be a badge of honour, if you're paying for a product or service, don't get it twisted."

"A somewhat wild experience I had a couple years ago was seeing at least 6 or 7 Bugatti Chirons all on the road at the same time driving in the area around Sonoma Raceway. I mean aren't there like, not many more of those than that, period!? It was pretty mind blowing."
"7:29 the logic here is actually incorrect. In a collision, THE TRUCK will be fine but ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù the driver will most likely not be because the deformation of a car is actually what absorbs the energy of an impact, protecting the driver. The Cybertruck has yet to be rated by the IHHS or NHTSA."
You're not usually this terrible at reviewing. That conclusion at the beginning was plain stupid. People react like that when they see other expensive cars. It's most dangerous feature is how it crumbles on impact.
I'm in Tampa FL and since it came out I have seen about 10 of them in different areas plus a truck full of them. Every time I see one it's like the first time. I want one to wrap it yellow!
It‚Äôs awful ü§¢
"iconic: it's not really futuristic, it's retro-futuristic. But I do wonder how it'll hold up."
There is no place on planet where the Ford Sierra is considered iconic.
Of course the internet is full of hate from people who spend too much time in artificial and unhealthy environments. That's my takeaway from the intro.
it's faster than other EVs cus it uses less computing power to render.
15:15 Marques turns into Engineering Explained üëèüëè
This would have been perfect for Robocop.
I suspect there will be two cars in NYC's MOMA collection soon enough... it's existing Smart Fortwo and a Cybertruck. Both are polarizing but stylistically? Iconic!
This what apple would make if they make cars

"Pertaining to the journey from rare majestic wonder to mass market truck, the original Hummer could be parallel."
why didnt he talk about range it gives?
why does your lens suck so bad
"I can 100% back up that PT Cruiser experience. We rented one back when it was new, and stopped at an apple stand (the fruit) in western Washington. I was trying to catch the eye of the girl running the stand, but she just completely ignored me and looked past me breathlessly saying ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs my dream car‚Äù. So, yeah it was insane looking at the time. But once you see one with a hole in the exhaust, brake dust stained front wheels and a duct taped on plastic window, the sheen wears off."
"That thing gets uglier every time I see it. It literally, not figuratively, looks like it was designed by a 6 year old trying to draw something ""cool"" for their dad."
"I can tell you why the biker was unhappy; you're driving something that ensures his death more than any other car on the road. 

I wonder how many pedestrian, cyclist, and biker fatalities this thing will cause. I can guarantee it'll be an outlier in the statistics..."
These will not be as special once you see them as often as a model 3. In SoCal they‚Äôre dime a dozen
"All good with the Tesla Cybertruck, but...the ""drive by wire"" feature... Underrated AND overrated at the same time! Does it make your life easier? Of course!

Okay stop milking Cyber truck this much. We need good content!
Can marcus brownlee talk about the lack of a crumple zone with the cyber truck
"10:05 ""truck stuff"" with two trucks in the backround accompanying the Cybertruck. Nice touch üëå"
"Normally, you have been a voice of reason when it comes to tech, so I have really enjoyed your videos. If you were paid for this video, good for you. If not, this was really weird to watch, as a subscriber."
"What is the maintenance like for this kind of truck ,"
I think the main reason why Tesla did the race with a Porsche is to subtly show people how good a Cybertruck + Porsche combo is üëÄ
"So much bias in this review. Somehow a thumb down from a random biker is equivalent to ‚Äúdisgust‚Äù and representative of 50%. No way, I‚Äôve watch a number of unbiased reaction videos and it is not even close. People for the most part love the design of the Cybertruck."
"Amazing vid, now lets delta chooms."
"I would think the same iconic appeal can be said for a regular tesla. now its like seeing a jeep and saying 'oh, look.' The lack of physical controls and user elements are my main pain points. Hummer EV has nice controls"
"Tesla is amazing, damn"
"They honestly could've made the cybertruck look 10x better by adding in some more straight lines. Steeper windshield, then a flat cab, then point it down towards the back and back up again across the bed. Would've had the same cyberpunk aesthetic but without it being a janky dump truck, and it would've made the cover for the bed much more usable"
Give it a year. The hype will probably wear off
Pretty cool !
The best that thing can hope for is infamous.
"I just wished they didn't downsized it 5% between initial proto/presentation, and production model. This was a really weak move.
One more thing, it might have to be checked but as far as some people analysed the aerody,amics of the CyberT, it is far from being bad, because of some pretty clever tuning of the upper roof ridge angle cause certain flow regime. Again, someone might correct me but leaks in this vehicule's driving efficiency might be found more in tyres than in aero."
Iconic like the Edsel or the Pinto or the Lancia Beta... The most dangerous thing about the cybertruck is it's faulty accelerator pedal
"SPOILER ALERT That race with your Porsche was so unexpected and insane üò±God, I love your videos! Also, I love how you defend your child, I mean car, a car of course."
The Cybertruck is the Galaxy fold of the EV world.
"The cyber truck isn't big, it's heavy. And yes you can go stop light to stoplight fast, but can you stop when a pedestrian steps out infront? Just like the percentage of people that actually tow, what is the percentage of people that actually race other on the road all the time?"
"For me, it's kinda ironic that they chose standard 911 and not turbo s which would crush cybertruck in drag race."
what a brilliant video!!!
The production quality is Amaziiiiiing
It's easy to give a vehicle you got for free a good review.  Starting to wonder if this is poc unbox therapy.
"I got a longbed truck and tow stuff with it all the time. I tow my cargo trailer. I tore down a house and towed it to the landfill. I use it to carry my big kayak. And I scrap metal too. I hate seeing people with trucks that don't use them. They take up space, cause a ton of pollution, and are very dangerous to pedestrians. Most people only need sedans. Because even sedans are a waste of space, most people don't care anything more than a backpack and the other 4 seats are wasted too. But that's another issue, American cities are designed to force you to drive. All that most people need though is a car. If they need furniture, paying one time delivery fee or renting a uhaul truck would save thousands of dollars compared to buying a whole truck to use just once a year. Even if you do haul a lot of stuff, a pickup is still not the best. A cargo van has much more space and is lower to the ground, making loading easier, and it's kept secure, instead of having stuff in the open bed, and protects it from the elements. So again, most trucks, even for cargo, aren't needed. Sure some people use them, like farmers. Or for recreation. But not for everyday commute."
He forgot to mention it's rare because they know they can't sell many because it looks TERRIBLE!
Frontal crashes = get impaled by the steel that doesnt bend.
I mean... it's name says it all. CYBERtruck
I love this truck
real
Marques hands down is the most honest and best reviewer.  Just discovered him surprisingly only 2 months ago and he's incredible.  Reviews are well done and he keeps it real
"Why has he not brought up the fact that its an objectively bad pickup truck because the bed space is absolutely tiny compared to any other comparable truck, or that its literally too unsafe to be legal in Europe, where even the equally massive F series can sometimes be bought, or that basic features such as the rear camera become all but unusable at night, or that the headlights are so badly designed that they blind other drivers due to pointing slightly upward instead of straight ahead, or that the range is 300 km less per charge than Elon touted, or that it rusts INSANELY EASILY compared to other cars and trucks because its UNPAINTED, or that its automatically closing front trunk lacks a sensor so itll sever any fingers without stopping, or that the edges are unfinished and unrounded meaning you can peel vegetables with it, or the other stuff that a truck half its price has which works way better, as much as he should have? Its legitimately an unfinished product that should NEVER have been released in this state. Literally we have seen a PROPER high end electric pickup in the Rivian. NONE of those issues in the Rivian because its got actual QA and testing. Anyone who makes these videos should be WARNING PEOPLE NOT TO BUY ONE BECAUSE THEY ARE UNSAFE AND NOT READY"
It looks cool but its a death sentence in a crash

Make a review on Xiaomi SUV
"I remember when the Prius first launched. They were a rarity to see on the road and some (most) people hated the way it looked. Now, no one even thinks about seeing a Prius on the road. Same will happen with the Cybertruck."
if somebody hits you you'll be fine. Idk about that. Normally cars are made absorb shock.
I saw my first cybertruck yesterday and it was sick!!
"Why does everyone compare speed on a dragstrip? Yes, it might be faster 0-100 kph. But how fast is it around a race track, you know, with corners?"
sorry but I can't take anyone that would drive one of these things seriously.
Steer by wire is sooo underated
that's what I designed as a child with the 30 days AutoCAD trial
Just like when the delorean was released it was futuristic same thing really one of a kind
4:10 wait so no force feedbacküò¨
"What I love : 1) Steer by wire system that changes its ratio based on the speed. 
2) 800 Volt High voltage architecture with the newer cells, 400 and 800 Volt charging, and 48 volt low voltage architecture. (Bless you for pushing the industry in the right direction)
3) Wade mode.
4) Off road mode. (I guess that should be a default feature for every truck)
5) 4 wheel steering.
What I don't care about : 1) Bulletproof (Meh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ, I like guns, but I don't think I'll be gunned down while driving anytime. And, its not that bulletproof either)
2) Steel body invincibility hype. (There are plastic portions on the bottom, is that still invincible?)
3) Speed and acceleration. (This isn't the model s, that should have been model s's selling point)
     Honestly, why didn't they create a drive train similar to the Tesla semi?, it would have given it the acceleration that they so love, plus, give it the range that we require from a truck.
What I hate : 1) Ugly shape (The same approximate shape could have been remodeled to look better, but this exact shape is just 
ü§Æ. To mkbhd: The reason why people said it looks alien, is because they are trying to find words that do not make you feel bad about your purchase)
2) Towing range. (This is a truck, right?, why didn't they approach the design like they did for the semi?, they purposely changed the drive train for the semi to improve range, they could have done something similar here, then why not? just so that the one's who want to drive trucks like cars get what they want?, that's stupid, a truck needs to be a truck, everything else is an add on)
3) I love the minimalist interior design, BUT, and a big BUT, I WANT the gear change and turn signals to be physical stalks. I can easily imagine minimalist designs for stalks, example stalks with haptic feedback, and cybertruck'esk style sharply curved stalks, they will look better and wouldn't require as much expensive hardware but still get the job done. Also, they just went back to the center horn, but I hated that feature as well, its borderline dangerous, horn needs to be on the center of the wheel, no compromise."
Wers rabbit?
"Ok we get it, you're getting shitloads of money from Tesla, enough already."
"MB should have noted that the Cyberbeast would in fact beat the base 911 Carrera T in the full 1/4 mile if it wasn‚Äôt towing anything. The base 911 Carrera is listed around 11.8 seconds for the 1/4 mile by Car & Driver.  10.9 < 11.8.  So yes, the Cyberbeast IS in fact faster than the base 911 from the Tesla video when it‚Äôs a fair non towing drag race. I do agree the video was a bit of disinformation making it seem like it‚Äôs faster in the 1/4 while towing a 911. But it‚Äôs still faster in reality in a fair 1/4 mile drag race.  MB‚Äôs 911 is a Turbo S and one of the fastest cars you can buy, so no one is claiming the Cybertruck can beat that in a drag race."
"""Already Iconic?"" Marques Brownlee needs to stop the constant shilling and hype for telsa, he has millions in TSLA stock so explains his bias but at least put TRY to be impartial"
Absolute stellar review!
Lambo to Bugatti to something like a cybertruck. haaaaaaaah
i live in a military town so nobody around here can afford one and i‚Äôve already seen like 5 of them passing through which is odd around here it‚Äôs so fuckin bad in person lol
What a high quality content. My god!
"The point about stainless steel is just wrong. Cars are designed to have crumple zones because they absorb the energy of an impact, delivering less energy to the passengers, making it safer. The cybertruck will be fine if you get in a crash, and it'll deliver all of that energy into breaking your bones."
It‚Äôs an iconic piece of trash and example of extremely poor car engineering üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Sorry friend but the most dangerous thing is definitely the pointy edges, with high acceleration/weight, combined with no crumple zones so it just kills any pedestrian as efficiently as possible. Hoping the DOJ gets involved with making this thing illegal"

Sucks that this isnt the r1 review
You guys made look the cybertruck look cooler with that animation and Intro!!!
"It‚Äôs a vehicle that‚Äôs more about owning one to show your status, than just being a normal car to drive to work, school, or to the grocery store."
"As a visual beast, I too am drawn towards the esthetic qualities of everything around me. Oh, but thine eyes do often deceive. Does it work? How long will it work? What is/are the trade off/s?"
"Jesus christ the quality of your videos is so good, it almost make me feel bad for watching for free. Keep it up dude!"
"It‚Äôs a beauty!

Away from the weirdos who loiter online, the real public generally love it."
"I wouldn't trust anything elon says, I'm sure more than just 15 trucks had the door issue..."
I saw one in the wild in Kansas City this last weekend.  I wouldn't buy one but if I did I would have to put a Frigidaire nameplate on it.   The old classic one with the scripted letters.
Another example would be a hail storm 7:20
Yoooooo Miles!!!!!
Audio sync is off üò¢ feels weird watching this video like this üò¨
The Aztek‚Äôs design was iconic‚Ä¶but not in a good way. I cannot understand how people are looking at this child‚Äôs drawing and saying it is cool
So nobody is going to talk about that sick intro?
"""If someone hits you, you'll be fine"", the lack of crumple zones will probably cause a lot of damage to its occupants and to the other car, not to count the life-threatening sharp edges . This car is a killing machine with wheels. Luckily it will never be released in Europe."
"Bro, can u even sit in the backseat?"
Someone‚Äôs got Tesla stock‚Ä¶
13:55 that was cool xD
I feel like the cybertruck will follow along the lines of the Model X. I had one when there were basically none around and countless people would come up and ask about the falcon doors and the massive front window. Now they're so many on the road no one looks at them twice.
Man I enjoy Marques' videos
i love how the video cropping makes it look full screen with no notch from my phone
"So they carefully worded it to NOT say the Cybertruck could beat the 911 in the quarter mile, but that's what we all mistakenly came away with when watching the video.  It's dubious.  I like Tesla and I'm saying this."
I feel we spent too much time on the drag race vs 911.
"Ive seen it up close in person. It looks MUCH BETTER in real life than in any photos or videos. I don‚Äôt know why, it‚Äôs an odd visual thing, but it‚Äôs really cool in person. Totally absurd and ridiculous, but cool lol."
"Marques is smart....Do you people can imagine how much is Elon Musk paying him for his ""honest' review for all Tesla cars??? Mannn....$$$$$$"
cool opening animation :D Nice and clean.
No wonder it's the cyclist that hates these cars. These are the people on the receiving end
@mkbhd's superpower is storytelling üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
So bored of these videos on the Cybertruck now.
"Intro is literally a scene pulled from Black Mirror season 2 episode 2 ""White Bear"" lol ü§£"
"LooooL Marques, you should go to Dubai, and you'll know that a Bugatti isn't that special"
"Idk if its going to be iconic, but it will be a classic. How long will the cybertruck keep its current design? Will there be any iterations? Will the upgrade/next gen from a cybertruck be a ‚ÄúTesla truck‚Äù?
So far Teslas have just slightly changed their appearance from one gen to another, but what if they do a radical change? See the Golf MK1 compared to the current iteration. Or a more direct comparison, see the original Ford F-150 to the current version, and they don‚Äôt look anything alike, hence why the older f-150s are considered classics."
I‚Äôve already seen several here in Miami and they look so unreal in person
The audio is different. It's not as crisp
Spare wheel?
"No, its not. Its a meme."
"I really love how bold the product design is. Wouldn't it be awesome to have many more car designs that wouldn't be just copy of each other.

Unfortunately, Tesla service and quality control are just plain broken. This makes buying any Tesla, let alone Cybertruck, a fool's errand."
Bit of Top Gear setup and editing @10:22
"As for the child, congratulations. Welcome to fatherhood and  wish you the best.üòÖ"
From an european perspective this is just stupid. Scrap all those car-centric cities and towns. These cars are a problem for everyone except the owner.
Elon presents the Cyber Roadster 411
I wouldn't really consider that iconic
Imagine simping for musk
"15 min in and i feel like im watching an ad. nothing is negative about this thing, there are no drawbacks and if there are, its your fault buy something else. lol"
i absolutely love the design
Not that big a deal but technichally deceptive advertising?
"The Most American product i ever saw.

That thing isn't iconic ... it's a meme on wheels and will age as well as it.
"This is the most burger-american product bar none. I am into cars but seeing how offensive, selfish, wasteful for no good reason at all this one is makes me understand the people who say that we all should just use trains instead."
That intro was a nod to modern marvels and I‚Äôm in love with it!
Refrigerator on wheelsüòÇ
"Do people dislike the look because they dislike the look or because they have to dislike anything related to Musk?
Half the haters wouldn't have a strong opinion if it wasn't a Tesla."
"I don't really understand how people can separate tesla from elon and choose to support them (unless obviously, they agree with elon's views on the world). Same for the day traders, I know so many people who despise elon but will go ahead and play the tesla stock game. I just can't do that, and don't understand people who can. I wonder if tesla would see any sort of bump if elon left, I am really curious about that, or maybe I just am in the minority of people who can't escape their morals."
looks like robocop becoming a transformer. üòÇüòÇ
Toyota (Lexus) did full steer by wire years ago with a yoke wheel on the RZ in 2023. It had input lag though. Any noticeable lag on this one?
Nice intro tbh
Your opening graphic sequences are sick üî•
i mean i like it looks sick its different and that's what makes it cool in my opinion
i farted into cybertruck
This is one of the highest quality MKBHD videos (and tech/car reviews) I've seen. Great work!!!
Where is Engineering Explained? MKBHD stole his whiteboard!
That's why its named Cyber Truck. A truck for Cyber Space only.
Nothing is iconic about this damn truck. Seriously stop talking about cars. You only speak on the fuckin Tesla.
"It makes people behave differently around them because it's bad enough someone bought a Tesla, they bought a Cybertruck. On top of them being shitty drivers, now they can barely see out of their stupid ""truck""."

Tesla is garbage.
"The original VW Beetle was massed produced and is ""iconic"". Just sayin'.."
3:33 how could they know its just bad design and bare bone shit cobbled together. Of course  the appearance and feature definitely distract from the actual design and construction of the product lots of stuff is just smoke an mirrors now adays listen to the opinion of a designer
I'm pretty sure the most dangerous part of the cyber truck is the lack of crumple zones
"For me, The Cybertruck/Tesla's biggest roadblock is Elon Musk as a public figure. He's such a polarizing figure and his association with the alt-right crowd is turning many people off from wanting to associate with his companies or support him in any way."
The biggest thing demonstrated in this video was Marques's vanity and ego.
Now you know how people around motorcycles are.
It's not bullet proof for anything 225/5.56 or above.  Jerryrigeverything shot it with a .50Cal and it went right through.  So its kinda false advertising.
1:43 wait aint one of the biggest complaints is the headlights are angle up so they actually are ahining in peoples eyes even tho they are so low

"I'm sorry but I feel like the whole video was just gaslighting people to make them think cybertruck is really awesome. ""It's just a drag race. No big deal"" is one of the most gaslighting thing I have ever heard. I'm a car and bike enthusiast and I frankly admit the defeat of the ICE cars and trucks when it comes to acceleration compared to EVs and I do realise that EVs are going to be the future. But that doesn't mean you can misinterpret an actual fact just so that you can look cool and make people buy your products. ""This is going to be just like other SUVs and that's fine"" - No it's not. SUVs are such a big problem on the roads. And with a design and material like this on the road, good luck anyone getting hit by these even at the lower speeds. This exists with ICE SUVs too. And that's the point. My respect for MKBHD has gone to the depths. ""Everything we love about Tesla and the other things that comes with it"", why not say everything we hate about Tesla as well? Such a fanboy. I don't mind him being a fanboy to the Teslas or any other EVs, but when you review stuff as an influencer be as unbiased as possible. You're no different from Elon Musk who tricked us into believing CT is quicker than 911 in a quarter mile"
iconic scam
"What a lot of people don't get is that the cybertruck is a monetisation of R&D for the future. They can sell it for a high proce to launch new technologies they'll need for the future robotaxi.
Steer by wire: allows you to deactivate and retract the steering wheel for robotaxi passengers. 
48v power and ethernet communication between modules, they can get a lot of experience with this on the cybertruck and have a better solution in place by the time they launch the cheaper car."
"Idk if it was done intentionally but starting from 10:12 the comparatives about the van, suv, a car (sedan) and hauling (with the truck in the background) has to be the most beautifully created cinematography piece i have seen on YouTube! Marques never fails to amaze me with his quick wits and attention to detailüëèüèº"

"good video, but I think it misses a very important opportunity of speaking about the actual idea behind electric cars, and how completely twisted they are getting by Tesla. We are moving away from combustion engines for a reason that is not speed, or sound volume, or modernity, it's mainly a thing of saving energy and going towards sustainable, environmentally friendly cars. The Cybertruck, along many other electric trucks and SUVs takes a complete 180 turn on this, with its over 3 tons of weight and basically everything it is designed (not) to do. I would have wished to have this pointed out at least, instead of blindly (and maybe even kind of appreciatingly) doing drag races with it and shining the light on the pure marketing side of the vehicle.

I know, this topic is controversial, but I'm European, and I simply have no understanding for why this thing exists and why so many people still drive such huge cars in the US. It's just painful, honestly."
"Brother,
This was a Fun & clever video covering many of the media fud and facts. üòé 
As for me, I love the CyberTruck, its futuristic looks, super innovations, and stunning performance. I say this in spite of loving sports cars, and having owned two 911's and other sporty cars. 

You're so RIGHT about the rear view mirror major miss (perhaps a gov't overlord issue), and the towing was a massive miss in spite of the irrelevant 6% factoid when considered a pick-up truck. We by a pick up so we can anything needed, if we need!  I've used my RAM 1500's to tow my boats and campers ... Tesla's use of that 6% factoid is not well thought out and more a defensive posture because battery capacity has not progressed adequately to support the 500+ mile range.  Perhaps the biggest letdown of the entire CyberTruck release!  I still hold hope they will soon resolve this with improved 4680 or other developments.

My take on the Stainless finger print issue... it is silly, but admittedly also why I no longer consider black cars, and which I'd say are worse for Dirt and Fingerprints than the Stainless CyberTruck. Stainless is a uniquely benefit for Tesla! This because Tesla/SpaceX Stainless cost benefits for a truck and I am a massive fan.  Sharing with SpaceX Starship vehicle massively is unique in bring costs down... once the ""big brain engineers"" designed the ""machine that builds the machine!""  Both vehicles are made from an austenitic stainless steel alloy called ""Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel"" for its high strength and Corrosion Resistance.
I believe it's also a showcases for the versatility of this particular stainless steel alloy... which may be considered for a future RoboTaxi and this heavy-duty CyberTruck pickup.

Cheers, Eric"
"Someone explain to me the ‚Äúquick versus fast‚Äù thing when the cybertruck is software limited top speed? 

That‚Äôs not an inherent EV thing, that‚Äôs a software safety thing. Put different wheels on it and it‚Äôs quicker and faster."
CT vs 911 Turbo S‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Tesla took a base 911 in their video.

"Cool review, and I can see the good things that this kind of vehicules adds to the formula, but I miss a few points in your review: 

- What about the nefarious planned obsolescence that is behind this kind of cars?

- What about safety while you have an accident, both while driving this and for people that collide with it? 

- What about firefighters taking you out of this truck? in my understanding, the less resistant the material of a car is, the more chances you have of surviving.

- What about the right to repair these cars? you kind of always miss that part in your Tesla reviews.

- How will this truck hold up in the future to maintain it, since all Teslas depend on software updates, screens and sensors?

- What about the environmental issues that this kind of tech causes (I talk about screen-wise and materials to create it)? Lets not forget that although electric bateries aren't gas, they still are reaaally hard to recycle.

Cheers!"
Still waiting on mine...first day order. But nothing.
"i wont be harsh.. but they need to work on it... look at a jaguar xj6 (the materials, craftsmanship) and this.. the tech is conceptual and futuristic, but something seems not till the end for the price.. they need to work on it a bit.. aand somehow i hate the disconnect..like steer by wire and inserting all these computed proceses between my direct control.. but maybe im old school.. the Porsche sounds and looks great !!!"
Not wanting to be associated with Elon‚Äôs public persona/politics has got to be one of the top factors against the CT at this point.
The production quality of this video is so high. Feels higher than a top gear episode

Not a good review to be honest. I was hoping for a more balanced review. this was just you fan boying Tesla and the truck.

"@mkbhd you made this mistake on your previous video (I think on the other channel) but since a few people had already pointed it out in the comments, I didn‚Äôt. At 20:58 when you talk about ‚Äòroll and yaw‚Äô, what you actually mean is roll and pitch. Yaw is not the rotation around the axis that runs perpendicular to the left and right side of the car (that‚Äôs pitch), yaw is the rotation around the axis that runs perpendicular to the top and bottom of the vehicle. Great content all the time BTW."
yep thats exactly how i acted when i first saw one!
"The CyberTruck IS AWESOME!! Saw it for the first time at the Petersen Museum and I knew it would be cool - but in real life... WOW! And the skins people are putting on make it even way more awesome.

All the haters in the comment section are mostly people who don't live in a country that would allow such a big truck without a special license. And it is awesome to see the truly unique view of auto design by Tesla - they have changed the landscape so many times - and with... dare I say... the Roadster 2.0 collaboration with SpaceX.... oh oh - get ready for something INCREDIBLE!!!!"
"It‚Äôs a huge disappointment how you barely addressed the safety issue, the fact that this ‚Äúcar‚Äù is literally illegal in the EU and is just dangerous to everyone not sitting inside a Cybertruck themselves."

"The PT Cruiser is not the best analogy.  I think a better  one would be the Beetle. Very rare and weird at first.  Caused quite a stir.  Then became so iconic that kids punched each other in the arm when they saw one.  With four older brothers ""Slug a Bug"" meant something.  As a 20 something owning one and tinkering around with it adding after-market gear from JC Whitney was a lot of fun.  CT will be a modern day version of that."
"You're right with the PT Cruiser.. Their marketing must of been great, I'm only 35 years old but I remember it and it being like that. I remember they had this cool little PT Cruiser branded pocket knife that was in the shape of a credit card and would fit in your wallet. Also the Hummer brand revival was pretty ""Iconic"", but you hardly see them now and when you do you're like bleh."
"I think the more appropriate term is ""ironic."""
"Kind of a weird review here basically ignoring how dangerous the vehicle is, how bad it is at being a pick-up, how bad it is at being a normal car, how bad it is at being a sports car, how the stainless steel eventually corrodes. 

Waving things off as ""it's a founder tesla so it's expected that we pay nearly 100k to test something that is just another one of Elon's reddit moments: A 5yo's view on what a cool car is. 

If they had kept it in the drafts that would've been one thing, but to actually manufacture this poorly constructed pedestrian mower 9000 (and the fact that it's even legal in the US) when tesla could've been dedicating the extra R&D budget to a model 2 (or anything that actual people want to drive on a daily basis), goes to show that tesla doesn't actually care much for the environment after all. 

And the fact that Marques just glances over these things and presents this monstrosity in a positive light going so far as to say him and his team will be using it on the daily also speaks volumes to his bias. If Tesla needed time to update their software and squash some release date bugs, MKB would've held out on the review 100%, something he didn't do for Fisker (and something I agree with ofc, which makes it all the more confusing how he could present this mess as a ""good car"").

The quarter mile segment was just the cherry on top. He just said ""yeah tesla is straight up lying to their consumers, I won't actually engage with this and will instead move onto the next segment where I praise how the stainless steel helps you murder a few extra children on your next road trip"""

These types of cars scaled down could be the new normal for lower income if made properly. These will last, not as much need to fix up outter shell, if they aimed to the right audience after these trucks, i'd call them down right dumb for not aiming market properly. I'd get one if it's scaled down to a normal smaller sized car, take out lots of electronics, make it more mechanical, and maintain in winter, these would be great for everyone."

"Most cars come with crumple zones so the car will absorb the majority of an impact and not transfer it to the passengers. The Cybertruck doesn't so that so people have been in car accidents in these trucks where the cybertruck looks fine and the other car is destroyed, but the driver of the cybertruck is the only person injured"
Put an old a you got on your homework on it with a magnet
What these reviewers don't seem to understand. IS that the Cybertruck is all about Utility. Long after the hype has gone the Cybertruck will carry on as useful truck without the expense of maintaining fragile painted body panels and with a drive train designed to last 1 million miles or more. I think I just bought the last vehicle i'll ever own. I'm looking forward to never waxing or repairing dents again. I absolutely don't care about what other people think about it. The Cybertruck gives the middle finger to fancy paint and trim. Its the ANTI Cadillac! Its the Anti G-wagon!!!

This disconnect between what that 40-something-percent-or-less of Actual Truck People Who Do Truck Things need is no doubt where some of the chuckles come from, but yeah. As you noted, the Cybertruck's main use case for most buyers is as a flashy SUV on the street, and kudos for being self-aware enough not to go full Leeeeeeeroy Jeeeeeenkiiiiiiiins off-trail like a goofball with unrealistic expectations of its off-road chops, ha.

I have never seen you make unbiased video. Like for apple . You might highlight some of the very little nuisance, but will still keep using Apple products and no matter how good Windows laptop is you will find some silly mistake and make it look very big MKBHD going hand in hand with big brands without showing it sponsored."

You can also make the same argument with the Model S. They used to be head turning when they first came out and now no one really cares cause there is so many of them. If Tesla does ramp up production to a similar point, the unique factor will wear off and people will kinda stop caring about it."

It's a beautiful car, and when it was rare to see surely it was a joy to look at. Now that the deliveries have streamlined and there are many of them on the road, the car because of its sheer driving pleasure, comfort and looks it has become one of most sought after cars. And surely it'll go down as an icon in Indian car industry."

Tesla was never iconic
It is a halo product and therefore as iconic as the MacPro wheels. It is not a car for the average-joe and was never meant to be. And just as the MacWheels it shows how disconnected Musk and Tesla are from the rest of the world.

"The reason people won't tell you that it's ugly in real-life and that they're using words like ""alien"" or ""sci-fi movie prop"" is because they don't wanna make you feel bad for having spent a fortune on the ugliest car in existence."
This was a very entertaining video.
10:02 Is that optimus prime.
"The trolling comments on this video is proof of how the Cybertruck disrupts the stagnant, partial designs of boring trucks these days.

It will be so revolutionary that people will talk about how they hate and love it, and how it will always turn heads and grab people's attention.

This is Tesla's work at another peak."
"You mentioned off roading in this, it would be great to see you review a Land Rover on Autofocus and visit a Land Rover Off-Road Driving Experience, maybe even one in the UK to see what these vehicles are capable of."
production on this one sheeeeshüëå
How to write a title that doesn‚Äôt alienate baby Musk. üòÇ
Cybertruck is the future ü§©
What an intro!!
"Very sad to see such a video from Marques, finally , he is a sellout :( it is a Truck, test it like a truck, not once did he try to sit in a back seat, try it, your head is not gonna fit, and it;s a truck."
"Yeah.  That car is so dangerous, it's not allowed on European roads.  I mean, be honest about it at least."
"The Tesla minimalism is the crux why I would never own one of these things. I want buttons and an actual dashboard, not some ugly tablet glued to the middle and doesn't even support CarPlay/Android Auto."
Blud really knows nothing about cars
"OMG, you had me rolling when you said well, we are here, and there is a Porsche waiting."
Tesla ü•∞
"A selfish, impractical car for selfish, impractical people. It is truly a car of our time."
1 Million views... Now do you understand why Tesla doesn't need to spend a cent on advertising?
"I get the PT Cruiser comparison but I feel like it‚Äôs the new Hummer H1. Big but not all that practical, doesn‚Äôt go far with a full tank, celebrities hype it up, eventually people come to realise that they are not all that - but still puts a smile on your face when you see it out on the road."
"Marques seems to have a different interpretation of the word iconic than most. It‚Äôs used to identify a product that stood out in it‚Äôs time for departing from the norm, setting a new standard in the eyes of the general public (not just enthusiasts)
Yes, the Countach, no, not the Veyron. Yes, the Citroen 2CV, Morris Mini, VW Beetle. No, not the PT Cruiser!
The Cybertruck is already iconic and once that‚Äôs established it can never change. Production numbers are irrelevant."
"I saw one in person for the first time yesterday.  I thought it was ugly in videos and pictures, but was surprised when I saw it is person. It looked even worse than I imagined. It really looks like $100 car that someone built in their garage out of scrap sheet metal.  This was the uglies vehicle I have ever seen."
This is the worst thing about it.  It's pure vanity.  This is useless to me.  Pass
"I do not consider buttons always to be the preferable. If fact the user interface in a car full of diverse buttons is often horrible both from viewpoints of aesthetics and usability.
I can actually prove it. Imagine a button for every functionality in a Tesla. The fart button would perhaps be funny - but it would be so cluttered. There is a reason why modern interfaces of complex machinery use touch screens. It also permits the user interface to be continually updated and improved by over the air updates. Further, hundreds of buttons is asking for maintenance problems down the road. Ever tried an old luxury vehicle? The number of broken buttons is always notable.
Whether Tesla has removed too many buttons is another discussion (stalks...)"
üíØ
I‚Äôm impressed at the lack of reverb in that warehouse space
"Cool Deutscher Frisbeesport-Verband e.V. Shirt! Have you recently been competing in Germany? 
Greetings from Berlin"
It's amazing what marketing can do these days. Such a Pavlovian era.
One of the ugliest cars ever made.
sell out
"Those drag times are ridiculous, it's like my grandma being one second slower than Usain Bolt, you gonna tell me she's slow? üòÇ"
"I would also photograph a good supercar if I saw one on the road, given the price of the Cybertruck. Yes it is iconic, but I far more enjoy the sheer engineering in the vehicle."
"The Cybertruck would not be dogged on near as much as it is if it wasn‚Äôt because Elon is such a controversial political figure. Adversely, the Cybertruck would not be hyped near as much as it is if it wasn‚Äôt because Elon is such a controversial political figure. 

And I have to say that, as someone who neither loves nor hates Elon, I think it‚Äôs a pretty cool truck. Not the one I would choose to buy but I would love to drive it and see it up close. I just don‚Äôt like Tesla‚Äôs interiors. It‚Äôs minimalist to a fault. Like I want buttons in the vehicle, dammit."
I‚Äôm legitimately terrified to ever come across one on the road.
"Just because you're unique, doesn't mean you're good or useful."
Why doesnt the united states have car safety standards. This is genuinely ridiculous to have on the same piece of pavement as schoolchildren
don't confuse novelty with beauty
"when a phone guy makes a rewiev for a car.........""tehnology""    Still SHIT"
god damn the quality in this video
$100k MAGA hat
When client agreed your low polygon model and send it for production üòÇ
I just cant get over the fact that you can't drive it in the rain without it rusting.
Iconic PoS maybe
it is basura.
It's an expensive iconic piece of junk
It‚Äôs this generation Pontiac Azteck.
"Saw one while I was driving around Battle Ground, WA yesterday. Didn't realize that they had released yet. Whether you like the design or not, it's quite the attention grabber."
"It‚Äôs iconic for all the wrong reasons, I think. Didn‚Äôt deliver on almost all of its promises."
"0:55 people turn around not because it‚Äôs so cool (like sports cars), but because it‚Äôs unusual in appearance/strange. Just like homemade cars that enthusiasts make (They usually have these angular shapes)"
BUT NO RUST
In 10 years that stainless is going to look the same
thank god this will never be legal in the eu.
The Cybertruck is beautiful. It looks animated. Gonna be my next vehicle
why u just guess the feature I was thinking 1st try? cmooon dudeeee!
No comment about how it can chop your finger off? ü§î
Just realise i dont remember seeing a tesla logo on it üòÆ
"""You'll be fine"" - except no... You won't. The whole point of crumple zones is to dissipate energy, and to avoid transferring that energy into occupants (in both vehicles). A Cybertruck is going to have a high speed collision against something even less forgiving (i.e. a tree) and it's occupants are going to be come a pink gloo sliding down the interior. These things are death traps to people outside and inside.

There's a reason they're not allowed to be sold in Europe."
"Getting people's reactions of a car thats is an attention grabber is just dumb üòÇüòÇ sorry, I had to say it."
Tesla isn't the first company to use steer by wire. Infinity did years ago
"I think you're downplaying the disgust a bit in that last anecdote, I know the review should be about the truck itself and I think you do a relatively good job, but plenty of people don't like the truck because of the CEO of the company. That's valid criticism when that CEO is so outspoken and such a negative influence on discourse. Plenty of people like that cyclist also don't like the size, weight, and speed combo of the truck which is lauded in the car community but should have almost no application on the streets, if drivers are prudent in their driving (spoiler, they won't be). There will be a spotlight on these trucks when they are involved in stupidity, and there should be, IMO, because of the attitude of the company selling them, and their sheer excess."
"Excluding the safety issues, I have and continue to enjoy the look of the cyber truck."
37% of truck drivers use their trucks for towing. Already being affected by the recent Veritasium video.
"No please dont, when we ask Tesla for an under $35k car and we get this pos 'truck'.... its a please no thank you. At this point Tesla is the new Apple, every fan boy out there is going to buy whatever new Tesla comes out."
"Here is my rebuttal to the PT Cruiser: I think the cyber truck will be iconic, in the way the 911 is iconic. Both of them have 1M units plus, and they still turn heads."
Iconic levels of cringe. You wouldn't see me dead in one.
"The truck is ugly af. 
No question. 
However, I'd drive it, lol."
"more 911 Turbo videos, please"
What‚Äôs with all the annoying anti car people in this comment section?
A bunch a great takes to argue both pros and cons of the CyberTruck. Great video!
50th video on Cybertruck on one channel -_-
"I agree with it wearing off. I work at Tesla and live in Austin. I see them everywhere. Not the same effect, but still think they‚Äôre pretty cool. Especially since I‚Äôm seeing different wraps on them."
Great review üëå
This is Iconic Indeed. Iconically Bad.
"4:42 Lexus rz 450e already did steer by wire, but alas my comment will be buried"
"The most dangerous thing about the cyber truck is 




























That it can 
actually rust and it hurts your wallet"
The ‚Äúmy child‚Äù is wild üòÇ
"The Volkswagen Beetle is iconic. The 911 is iconic. Etc, etc."
"This sh¬°tbox will be banned in most of the countries around the world. Thats a death machine lmao.

FAFO Elon."
Love it‚Ä¶can‚Äôt wait to get one ‚Ä¶ I love love love my model 3
This truck is like RoboCop future. It is beautiful in my opinion A lot of cars will copy
Jesus Christ is the ultimate icon
"All the cybertruck discourse seems to ignore that the worst people you know are likely to enjoy this car, and it's almost certainly greener by a long shot to whatever other bullshit car they were driving before. A net upgrade to society."
We're starting a weird timeline where hipsters line up to buy pickup trucks...
Vid go hard asfüî•üî•üî•
"One of the best MKBHD videos, when I realized we were actually doing a drag race, it made my day!"
The bolts used to secure the door loosened and fell‚Ä¶ so the cybertruck is secretly made by Boeing?! ü§î
The intro transition to animation was sick
"This wasn't the first car with steer by wire + dynamic steering ratio, lexus rz had it first also with a crazy steering wheel that actually made sense (opposite to the Tesla model s)"
"Instant icon, just add influencing"
The Cybertruck is what happens when you import a free 3D asset into Blender and the subdivisions are set to 0 in the viewport.
th
Damn! That's such a high quality video! Kudos to everyone who worked on this!
Free Palestine
That intro transition üóø
1st world problems: worried about fingerprints on vehicle 
"Steer by wire is an option in some lexus cars for a long time now, ironically it came out as a gimmick to make use of the lexus yoke."
That ‚Äúyou'll be fine‚Äù was sus üòÖ
"18:52 and pretty unsafe for anybody around you not in a tank. You failed to mention the ""safety"" features. For one: this car does not have crumble zones, very unsafe for the passengers in case of a crash; second: the dimensions, weight, lack of pedestrian safety features etc. also very deadly for pedestrians (maybe you did mention those things in the auto focus video)"
"Imagine trying to justify the Cybertruck isn't as fast as the fastest 911. Who cares man, it beat the entry 911 while towing it on the 1/8 mile on all terrain tyres, that's impressive enough for such a heavy truck.

Let it go. Move on."
Those foundation early adopters units üòÇ
As an engineer that steer by wire is scary  to me‚Ä¶.electronics fails like crazy and there‚Äôs so many reasons why. Nope.
Reminds me of DeLorean
Well done!
sorry marques but you know nothing about cars
Great video!
Holding up the left lane on 1&9 in Jersey for rollers is crazy üíÄüíÄ
People  dont turn their heads because its iconic. They are curious about the idiot that actually bought it.
Steer by wire was first introduced by Lexus RZ in 2023 bozo
Why buy a Lambo when you can just buy a Yangwang
It looks so nice going thorough NY
Slap a DBRAND skin on it to hide fingerprints
Didn't tesla test the Cybertruck against a 911 plain on the add?  Why people keep racing against a 911 turbo?
"Mass produced and iconic - nothing comes to mind. Except the 911 right there in the video - one of the most iconic cars ever made, and mass produced to this day üòÑ"
"They never should have called it a truck. If they had marketed this as the DeLorean 2, we'd be talking about a BttF reboot right now."
"VW Beetle, Mini Cooper - these were ICONIC, but mass produced as well

Also, the mods / customization market for the Cybertruck is gonna be so crazy... just wait"
"I probably would take a pic as well, just because it is so ugly."
What's with chromatic aberration??
"‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be fine‚Äù in an accident isn‚Äôt really fully correct. Because your car now has no crumple zone, you have nothing to dissipate the energy of a crash, so that force is going straight to you and your neck. 

At least if you hit someone else you have their crumple zone, but not if you hit a much more solid object like a thick concrete wall."
Wrong. Toyota put steer by wire in a mass production car first I believe.
Idk about anyone else but I still go in awe when I see a Tesla even if I've seen them a lot more. Maybe just me.
I love how this car is somehow the intersection point between hardcore tech and car YouTubers
I love it. Thanks for the review. Will wait for Gen2.
Liked the vid just for the intro animation(cybertruck style)
As usual great video. But Marques was sleeping at the tree lol üòÅ
Love the shirt üá©üá™
The funniest thing is how everyone is paying attention to cybertrucks for the wrong reason. They're hilarious and the people who bought them are so easy to laugh at. In the communities I'm in I see pictures taken of these trucks and the entire time it's everyone laughing at them
"You failed to mention the most obvious problem with this thing: it‚Äôs dangerous. If you hit a pedestrian or biker with this thing, they‚Äôre dead. If you hit another car, they‚Äôre totalled. There‚Äôs a reason why other cars use plastic or thin metal paneling.

This thing is a hit-and-run machine."
"everytime i see the cybertruck, i think of the old school Moon Patrol Arcade game from when i was a kid"
For me its just half ir an unrendered truck that elon released to save the production cost üòÇüòÇ
"Bro is a Tesla fanboy, of course he thinks this ""truck"" is great."
"This truck is like a novelty or collectors item, a show car basically. I wouldn't drive this as an everyday car lol."
The best reviewer mam what an explanation between fast and quick üòÆ
get the black wrap
"As my Dad used to say, ""you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear""."
This is the most ugly looking car I ever seen
Marques wearing an official German frisbee team jersey at 15:16 was the most random thing ever. I'm German and I didn't know that exists.
"its funny when you say I will tell you if its overrated or not, why cant people decide not only one person who collects his wage by marketing brands and tech. this is stupid."
"personally, I‚Äôm not a whiny little bitch. My support for renewable energy goes way beyond something that can be fixed in minutes. All car manufacturers go through this, all."
"But as you said, the cyber truck governor limited it at 114mph, if let to continue what and if would have been the cyber trucks max rate and how would it have done in that case."
No.
"The steel is martensitic, right, so Tesla hasn't really created some super new type of steel, the ""just"" invented how to make more or less regular steel martensitic. So you get this amazing steel almost for free, and without making it thicker. It's ""just"" super good engineering."
car guy maques arc in full swing and i love it
I could never hate on a car or truck design specially something new & wild. Hater always going to hate specially on stuff they don‚Äôt have or can afford is why they call hater üíØ their failures in life are always going to be projected as Hate.. üíØüíØüíØüó£Ô∏è‚úåüèª
"The quick vs fast comparison reminded me of Usain Bolt. He used to do what the 911 does, didn't have a great start of races, but halfway he had recovered and was side by side with his opponents and by the end he was so far ahead he could even slow down and stay ahead and win."
Love the cyber truck.  It's priced as it should be because it's such a show piece.  Personally I wished Tesla would just make a cheap EV truck that could compete with the Ford Maverick. Something people could buy and use that's electric. Fat chance Tesla make anything affordable like a Maverick
"Why is ""steer by wire"" called that if there are no wires?"
"It‚Äôs a tire eater. That AWD with AWsteering, tires will not last long"
"Iconically bad, sure."
"Awesome video, from intro to script it‚Äôs just flawless."
This video production quality looks so so good. Something has changed isn‚Äôt it @mkbhd ?
Such a cop out to say people who buy this truck should not expect it to be good for towing or offroading. That's what it was advertised for!
.
i'm so tired of complaints about carplay and android auto. it's as if ppl will die if they dnt have those!
Amazing production quality. Good review.üëç
I‚Äôm with the motorcycle rider üëéand as a chevy pick up owner I can‚Äôt see current pick up truck owners buying this electric vehicle.
"Nothing Iconic about this car... it is a ugly dangerous car, and the sharp edges are not a good thing neither is the material used. This car is a mistake, and I don't get the weird dumb hype about it. It doesn't even function as a SUV, nor as a pickup"
"I don't think I've ever watched a full video review for anything on YouTube. No matter how long your videos are, I'm always stuck watching the entire thing. Great script and captivating footage. Keep up the good work. I'm not even into cars. Awesome delivery always. üëèüèøüëèüèø"
Great review
"Brilliant, Marques - thanks! Detailed, logical, insightful, reflected, pragmatic - great stuff."
I would love and XS version for Europe
"Amazing vehicle. I'd love it if they made a smaller version (either sedan, wagon, or hatchback.)"
It's 3024 car
I do not want a car with the ability to stop steering because of a software bug/hack
Its hilarious you claim there isnt any iconic and mass produced vehicles when the majority of iconic vehicles were also mass produced.
Re: the effect it has on people around you. They‚Äôre most likely taking video to send to their friends to make fun of you for driving that shit.
Love the intro
I want my 100$ back

"Something that i find really interesting about these big cars is that most people buying them don't need them, they aren't that safer compared to a regular car, and are lethal for anyone in a smaller vehicle (or not in a vehicle).
Hope that North America escapes this car dependency hell."
"Iconic? Idk... 
Maybe it is not in my taste but, galvanized sheets as body, no paint, arch or curve. 
It looks like brutalist architecture of post modern era. 
Mixed with total digital control on screen and electronics. 

Maybe its a Tesla thing, they don't have defining features like headlights and grill in bmw, Audi rings and drl, Mercedes logo, grill and sound."
"The PT Cruiser‚Äôs image wasn‚Äôt tarnished by its ubiquity.  It was tarnished by its mechanical failures, poor quality, blown head gaskets, & flimsy construction. Cybertruck will last 100 years or more, & has none of these design flaws, not even the potential of them."
Honestly a bit disappointed safety (both for the driver and for pedestrians) wasn't talked about much here.
"I sadly only like the look, from the front and angled front xD"
Happy to see Miles on YouTube again.
"Yeah I agree a lot with what you say about the CT vs 911 drag race. When I saw the video my thoughts were that they were trying to make the most accurate price comparison, because the 911 they chose appeared in my 5 min of research to be the 911 that is most closely priced the same as the CT. Not sure if that was the reality, but that was my impression"
"Great and interesting video, Marques!
I appreciate the ""human"" quality you are maintaining in the production. AI inserts at every third word, lately, is already getting annoying. I prefer seeing the narrator speaking to me rather than a computer generated ""stock footage"" of the subject matter.
Again, great job. I am a 2019 reservation holder and love to get these informative updates on the Cybertruck.
Thanks."
"also dont forget, ""haters"" are online, not ""offline""."
"Still not a fan of the car, but shoutout to the editors and SPECIALLY whoever did that intro

Editing has been amazing lately"
It looks amazing! I can‚Äôt wait for mine.
"Elon, use the slow T manual,, Marques, Get me a real 911 xD"
"So then is it iconic, or is it a novelty? Considering the mention of the PT Cruiser, and knowing this will be mass produced, it comes across as a novelty rather than iconic. I'm not sure this as the aspirational status of a super car, or likely desire by other manufacturers to copy the aesthetic."
"üöò Wow, 2000 miles already, that's impressive! üëè"
"You US Americans really buy every piece of shit as long as it‚Äôs new and a celebrity promotes it‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt get it."
skyline is mass produced still iconic till date
Its an iconic failure of a car. Ego trippy toy
Disgusting.
thank you for comparing the cybertruck to the PT cruiser... it seems inevitable that in 20 years we will look back at the Cybertruck and see mostly hype
"The PT Cruiser was a retro design, this one is a futuristic design... Just sayingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ"
Shout out to Engineering Explained for debunking the CyberTruck drag racing a Porsche while towing a Porsche a couple months ago.
"The production on this video is a new high, even compared to the work you've done before, this is crazy. Great job to the whole team!"
"The cyber truck is one of the worst fucking things I have ever seen in my life, and one of the worst inventions there could be. Make a normal fucking electric truck."
Iconic is the way MKBHD & Studio team constantly one-up themselves every damn time on these videos! GD that intro was so sick!
iconic? more like a freak show.
Sick intro üî•
Steer by wire came out in like 2014 with the Nissan Q50. Please do a quick internet search before echoing Tesla talking points.
Did Kim Kardashian leave her headlight on at 25:37 ???
"Best review ever done on a product, nice step up here MKBHD!"
Iconic in the same way Mario 64 graphics are üíÄ
bir g√ºn bundan alacaƒüƒ±m
Great video!
"I know it was only like 5 seconds of the video but the bit with the two cybertrucks at 25:56 was really funny to me. Imagine being the people working there and not only do you have 1 cybertruck pull through, but two."
"If you drove down a street in an actual tank, People would look and take photos. If that happened every day, people would get use to it. Human nature, nothing new."
TBH it seems like most cybertruck haters seem to just be Elon haters. It seems like most random people on the street that have no feeling for or against Elon think that the car is really cool and interesting.
I‚Äôve seen plenty of reviews on the Cybertruck already. Why I do keep watching more? üòÇüòÇ
"Actually, the most dangerous thing about it is it doesn‚Äôt crush when it crashes into things, leaving the vast majority of the kinetic impact to get sent into the vulnerable human bodies inside."
"The PT cruiser was literally everywhere lol!!üòÇ you reminded me of that. I had a friend who had a PT cruiser that we lovingly nicknamed the PT ‚Äúloser.‚Äù 

On a different note, I just wanted to say thank you for the awesome videos. I enjoy watching them. Keep up the good work!"
"it‚Äôs a spectacle, it‚Äôs not an iconic design"
"Yoo, nice Frisbee Shirt. Gr√º√üe aus Deutschland!"
"I love it, I think it's cool as hell and awesome of a truck, totally useless as a pick-up truck, but I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't buy one if I had the disposable income to do so. For now I will just enjoy my my Model Y Performance."
"A+ for the design, thinking outside the box. But it seems unsafe, heavy/bulky and more like the product of a company making gadgets and software more than cars. I'll take EU made electric or hybrid cars over this, like something from Mercedes. I understand this is more a status symbol than a car and if you can afford it and have fun driving it around good for you. I cannot help but think that if you're an actual blue collar worker / farmer / builder you'd use something cheap and very easy to repair and that you wouldn't mind ruining while working"
another video by MKBHD that's making me feel broke in every aspect.
The butt fumble was iconic.
The Pontiac Aztek on steroids.
I do wonder if this will even be legal to drive in Europe. The stainless steel sounds great and all until you're in an accident and you'd rather have the car crumble aorund you.
I actually had a pt cruiser as a rental car for a month or two. It was a fun car
"Mankind is capable designing beautiful/ iconic cars some examples are already mentioned in this section but think of the design language of: 
- Porsche 911 - Bentley Continental -Aston martin -Citroen ds - 
They all have history and are capable of evolving it over time. 
This car is‚Ä¶ just a marketing object, and i highly doubt that you want to see it in 2034 anymore"
ü§£
"It's only iconic in the same sense the Pontiac Aztek is. As a complete ""what were they thinking"" failure."
That was cool how putting the blue hood on changed his outer jacket
Weird flex but okay: the video
i will await the first collision.. the damage to the other car will be very very big. where are the crumplezones?
"At the end of the day, the people who want one of these won‚Äôt be dissuaded no matter how many flaws you point out, and the people who don‚Äôt want one can‚Äôt be persuaded. It‚Äôs an incredibly polarizing product."
"I've worked in the car industry, foundation version issues is not a Tesla thing, all new series vehicles have that"
I really don't get the point of that thing you can't use it as a truck because it doesn't have a large enough bed 2 you can tow but not efficiently üòÇ
"its iconic because its absolutely the biggest piece of garbage of a car of all time, in every single possible way"
"It looks cool irl, not gonna lie"
"MKBHD is getting dumb, apparently this is a video thesis from many videos. Feels like people in his studio are awesome, not him."
Gotta work in that Porsche as a ‚Äúbusiness expense‚Äù
"I really do≈Ñt get it. Being recognised can‚Äôt be evaluated in such an early stage.¬†
All rare things get noticed - wear a red hat and people look at you. See it on every second head and you¬¥ll ignore it.¬†
Think of 2009 when some people had an iPhone and you immediately knew who had it, and now it doesn‚Äôt matter."
"Those edges are dangerously sharp, I don't know how this design passed the safety control.
You cut yourself only by hand washing this car, imagine you were on a bike and just slipped hitting one of these things."
Just want to say that animated intro was sick
"19:05 Yeah, to make it a fair drag race Tesla should have got a SECOND trailer and hitched it to the back of the 911 that won the 1/4 mile race...... NOBODY ever mentions the additional weight of the trailer....... to make if fair......"
"When your flex so hard, he is reviewing one, with a spare right behind."
"The amount of 'how dangerous this thing is in accidents' comments make me laugh. Do people not realize that the Cybertruck passed all tests necessary in this regard in USA, just the same as all other vehicles on the road?! Seriously, wake up already!"
Iconically absurd perhaps.
"I saw my first Cybertruck in the wild on a trailer along with an F-250 and was surprised at how big it actually is... I don't hate it... but I don't love it either. I was trying to compare it to other designs from the past... Airflow, Tucker, Avanti, Citroen CD... Pontiac Aztec? I think they achieved their goal of breaking the mold for pickup trucks but in doing so... is it still a truck? I learned to drive in a 1960 Chevy Apache w/3spd column shifter... no power anything except a V-8... so a no on it being a truck... lifestyle vehicle yes... truck no... even if you build it in Texas."
PT Cruiser was a POS
that crazy panel gap was iconic
first seeing MKBHD spout FUD in his vehicle. literally showing a pre production model get stuck in the snow and saying it can‚Äôt drive in the snow‚Ä¶new low MKBHD.
"About it being bulletproof. I think this can be a huge safety problem. Especially the fronts of cars have to be able to collapse in an accident to absorb a bing part of the impact force to cushion the driver/passengers. Making it bulletproof sounds like they basically removed this safety feature. This would now mean that the driver/passengers will receive the full force of an impact at once, which will cause much more serious injuries and/or fatalities in accidents."
What about rust?
"MKBHD another great review‚ù§üòä Cybertruck will be known as first big change in pickup design and reengineering of how its made. But it is just too out there to be a proper F-150 replacement. And not to mention that it is just for north America and maybe Australia, here in the EU will never get through pedestrian safety regulations, and it's just to big and heavy for our roads. üòÖüòÇ"
Let‚Äôs be serious it‚Äôs a horrible car üòÇ
"Marques, you're a really cool dude, and a great honest guy - and happy Easter, by the way . . . but there are two things that I don't understand from your presentation:

1. The idea that Tesla's new stamping process will ensure better fit and finish as Tesla Giga Texas gears up . . . to what I think you mean is full series production, and secondly,

2. The idea that it is overrated as a towing vehicle.

Unless the method of dealing with the 1.8 mm and 1.4 mm special order  stainless steel from Finland has changed s8nce Sandy Monroe got a tour with the engibeers and head of department around the time of delivery day -- then they are expressly not using stamping, but rather laser cutting and an air braked bending (to avoid bruising the exterior surface). There was an experiences production engineer speculsting on YT prior to the release that laser cutting and bending would conventionally limit (any other manufacturer) to 50,000 vehicles per year; it just takes too long compared with stamping. At least for anyone else. Of course, Tesla engineers may already have a weekly run rate proving me wrong here. But the point is that the fine tolerances demanded for the process they have chosen, this probably requires fit and finish problems to be ironed out very early, much ealier than you imagined. But - conventionally - at something like 3rd quarter 2024 Tesla hits the wall and has to decide if it can push the bending process, or if they have to start again with an actual stamping process. And remember, the new process was set up to cope with 3 mm stainless steel sheet.

The second thing was that are you meaning that all EV pickup trucks fail as towing vehicles. In the setting of a video production company working almost wholly in an urban setting, and without crazy deadines . . . I would have thought it could have been really goog. In terms of the feel of the trailer in relation to available power, and leveling and suspension generally. Also, the fact that you have the cover over the back. You can go to lunch an the fact that you have super expensive gear that can't be seen  together with sentry mode, even the foldup back seats, it all goes to make up a reall superior package - when you are hauling anything in a day of shooting.. I don't know. I've got to go to look at the Out of Spec Review of all the cutrent EV trucks towing trailers with a caf ontop - oer the Rockies. Admitedly, their chief reviewer has a lot of experience and none of the expectations of guys knowing and absolutely needing what a diesel can do. But, would you really be better off hiring an F-350 for anything yoh are needing or requiring?"
Deutscher Frisbeesport Verband Shirt goes insane
Great double take. Too bad designers cant drive their creations for a year before releasing ;)
"unique id say 
iconic would be something like ferrari 250 gto or some old merc"
00:36 she said holy shit hahahahha
what kills me is every supercar.. goes past and all you do is hear it‚Ä¶ then the wish list kicks in‚Ä¶
I got nostalgia to watching og top gear on this review and that made me so happy
"""So it's kinda hard to find something both mass produced and iconic"". He's absolutely right, notice how he said kinda hard not impossible. There are obviously a few examples of mass produced iconic cars. But you guys are acting like he said You can't find something thats both mass produced and iconic"
Bro the sledgehammer bit and your world record reaction had me dying üòÇ
Seeing Miles in the video was very very cool. Absolutely love his reviews and videos!
As always crazy good qluality on your vids
Smart move to see what phones the people are using ;)
How many bots are in this comment section saying ‚ÄúThe production quality on this video is insane!‚Äù Who tf says that? It‚Äôs word for word in a lot of the comments ffs.
Can we just appreciate the shots of the Cybertruck when driving on the road.
its iconicly bad
"Ye, people look because they cant believe someone actually bought this unbelievably ugly concept car."
Do you know what's iconic? Your intros
It‚Äôs the XKE from the 60s. Sooooo sexy

How much is Elon Musk paying all these channels to punt this piece of crap
11:38 63% right? Only 37% letft to reach 100%....  37 this number is everywhere wtf
"Something that is hugely overlooked is the rust factor of this vehicle. To keep it simple, you can't wash it like a traditional car, you can't let it stay dirty, plus if you want to ensure it doesn't rust, you must pay more for coating (by tesla & you dont even know for certain how long that'll last). I don't understand why more reviewers aren't talking about this."
I put the CT in the same category as the Hummer EV.  Vehicles I‚Äôll never own.
Elon must have cut you a fat check
"4:30 to 4:55 Harrison, JSQ"

"This is the next true Hummer. Tesla will rule with the ""H2"" and ""H3"" version of this."
80/20 (4:1) likes to dislikes is very telling of how the majority of people have no clue how dangerous the vehicle is.
The production quality of this video is just insane
"Like always, GREAT VIDEO!!"
"It's damn ugly and silly, will be just a blip on the radar in time. I do like your video reviews! Will make a great Hot Wheels car!"
Rip to the 1st person who gets into accident with this
Super futuristic look? A good thing since it's designed to last a million miles and that's over 70 average mileage years!
@9:12 This needs a serious fact check.  I don't think it's responsible to take this claim at surface value.
Military drone truck steer-by-starlink landed by Starship for wars.
"TLDR: Tesla's business model is simply not sustainable due entirely to Musk's petulant behaviour. 

We all know that Marques doesn't pay for his own tech or toys, but videos like this burn me up because it seems like he is saying, ""ah shit, well I need a new video to bump up views again...might as well praise something that is getting universally negative reception.""

The Cybertruck, at the end of all things, yet another overpromised and underdelivered ridiculous machine, created by and for aging techbros who have far too much disposable income for their own good, but cannot curb their narcissism. 

The entire reason that Tesla is staying afloat right now is because of Model 3 and Model Y, that's literally it. Every single other thing they do is eating them alive and has caused massive negative trends in their value... Not to mention their owner right now is the king of bigotry and stupidity who has made it his sole mission in life to become the main character of the planet as he reminds all of us on a daily basis that he is going through a midlife crisis.

Admittedly Tesla nailed a lot of things when it comes to EV's, but their time is sunsetting now with the rise of other companies going at it. The Cybertruck I feel marks either their downward trend into a nich√© product, OR them having to fully oust Musk and entirely rework their image."
is it pedestrian friendly??
"I want to see a video regarding battery degradation in EVs. The fact that first gen tesla models are so cheap now. The value depreciation is wild, atleast compared to gas powered cars."
time will tell üòâü´∂
The point is they over promised and under delivered
Didn't know you had a Child Marques. Congrats
"yeah, good for driving on Mars or maybe Moon, perfect environment and that about what Tesla wanted an SF Cybertruck , mission complete. Personally, if I‚Äôm to give that kind of money out it wouldn‚Äôt be for Cybertruck."
Ellis you freaking wizard! The audio especially outside is top notchh. Respect ‚ú®Ô∏è
It‚Äôs iconic like smallpox or a burning bag of dog poo

These are cars for those who have money to play with and nothing to lose.
Love the intro animation!
"The script in this video is so good, props to whoever wrote it. You guys are leveling up."
"""I never care about pannel gaps"" .... Ha, ha, ha, ha, hilarious !!!"
Minor correction.  They only ran 1/8 mile in the video because they would have exceeded the speed rating of the trailer tires in the 1/4 mile.  This was revealed on X in the replies to EE‚Äôs post. Could they have made it clear his race took place over only 1/8 mile?  Sure.
Iconic for being boxier than a cube car
The intro sequence and animations in this video are sick!!!
"HOW IS THIS VIDEO SO GOOD! The audio and music, the flow of your thoughts through stories, everything about this video is spot on. Very crisp."

"Maybe it will be mass produced, but practically speaking, most people still won't be able to afford one...
So much for the promised 40K cybertruck that would be in ""everybody's reach""."
"I feel like the rear wheel steering isn't on other trucks because the towing is best on a solid axle. When you put the steering knuckles on the end, you introduce a weak point or potential failure point under load. I do agree most folks don't tow as often or as much as they think when they buy a truck and how it impacts battery mileage is enough to keep it from really being much of an issue with this vehicle."
I think I see a bit of rust on the left side of your truck
"Does it look good üòÇ, i.drew nicer cars when i was 5, stainless steel body, guess someone skipped physics"

They're laughing at how stupid it looks. That's it.

Engineering Explained was wrong. Tesla's video vs the Porsche didn't show the fastest Cybertruck pass. They posted a video with the most dramatic ending. His math was off by a huge margin.
"Steer-by-wire's unsung benefit? Handling emergencies better than the driver. Deer/moose/bear/elk. Inattentive dog or person walks/runs into Cybertruck path. Drunk driver, either someone else or you. Driver seizure, stroke, heart attack, feints. Driver falls asleep. Avoid T-bone by stop sign/red light runner. In all these cases the Cybertruck can take effective avoidance maneuvers independently. This will improve over time with OTA updates."

I wouldn't have said PT cruizer.. more like the Pontiac Aztec. Equally as terrible in looks and performance.
I saw one yesterday and yes I did have that behavior
"In the early 80s, for a year or so, before Back to the Future, even, the Delorean was something that turned heads.  Now, it was not a good car, to be fair, but a gull wing stainless steel car. And the few I saw in the late 80s.... The steel on those models looked pretty bad by that time. Very blotchy. But the steel wedge design was something futuristic for it's day."
"""Early Tesla, they're going to find I guarantee, issues like this and work on them""

Wow, you could have said and you did say the same about the Fisker Ocean but boy, how did that get seen by the public? 

What's with your audience and Tesla fanboys... guess TSLA won't be dropping anytime soon thanks to your comments üôÑ"
"Except... you won't be fine because of the bulletproof steel. Having rigidity in your car frame and the lack of a folding front makes the vehicle MORE dangerous if it gets hit, because it doesn't absorb the impact and instead passes it on to the occupants."

"The autonomous mode doesnt yet work, the company often overpromises.

Of course I'm interested in EV's and technology in general not particularly just tesla the politics of the owner are quite controversial.

Doesnt mean I would discount any product, just I wouldnt say I'm over enthused either."
"One problem that's unsolvable is that by its design it's a pedestrian killing machine. It's like Tesla went out of their way to make it as deadly as possible short of installing spikes.
It's fast, nimble, heavy and has a high front panel made of sturdy stainless steel to crush the lower body or even ribcage* of anyone it hits.
*Ribcage for very small adults and any children."
"Imagine paying for premium car and the door doesn't close properly because it was not bolted right, woah! Americans will buy any shit with the right PR."

Excellent review and commentary. You nailed it!! Can‚Äôt wait for mine.
iconic is a good ironic word for such a car. I am so grateful that this thing basically illegal in places where I live.

"7:32 if your car remains practically intact after a crush it does not imply you will be fine, I would say the opposite.
The reason cars crumple is to absorbe the kinetic energy of the impact as much as possible."
The first steer by wire car I've heard of is a Lexus
"Miles does look a lot like you in the helmet :D Without the helmet only height, beard, eyebrows and ears give it away :D"
"10:05 This shot clearly gives me the vibes of ""Iron Man"" you know that movie where Elon borrowed his Tesla Roadster for as Tony asked for it."
Amazing video! Great production.
I'm very upset about the anecdote about the biker whose life is put in greater danger by the existence of the cybertrucks being contrasted with some random people in a car. Kind of gross and thoughtless.
Great review Marques. Thx.
"Doesn't Lexus have a steer by wire suv, i remember watching a video on it"
"Marques, you're awesome! Nice review as always... Keep it up üëäüèΩ"
If you don't like it just don't buy it... it's not so difficult... let people use whatever they like. I think it is perfect.
"A penny for that sick intro, please"
GOAT reviewer full stop
7:30 glass is glass & glass can break
"As far as its ""iconic"" arch, I think the best comparison is perhaps one of its inspirations, the DMC DeLorean. Not to say that Tesla will go bankrupt or that Elon will be busted for cocaine, but in terms of the look, it will hold its iconic value even after it's much more common because nobody will copy it."
That car has been mewing
"Best line yet.  So. "" I've expanded it here.....  Like Im bidding on the price is right. :)"
I strongly believe that Musk bro used stainless steel for cost saving because they already fabricate it for their rockets and this crazy design is only because you cant bend or mold stainless easily.

"Iconic? $40k and 500mi is iconic. $60k and 250mi is not iconic. I thought the car looked like this because it was ‚Äúcheap to manufacture‚Äù? I just cancelled my 4+ year preorder. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the look is obviously different. But plenty cars have different looks‚Ä¶. You get stares in any new car that has a buzz."
"It's already illegal to drive this vehicle on Swedish road, the angles makes it unsafe for pedestrian."
"Towing vs using the bed of the truck is the question. I‚Äôve owned trucks and have never towed but I frequently use the bed of the truck. Dressers, Refrigerators, lawnmowers, etc go into the bed all the time. The question should be how often do you use the bed. Model Ys can tow."

The Delorean was iconic but wasnt the greatest car ever made either
"22:38 to be fair, the biker probably thinks that about EVERY massive truck. They're a danger to him compared to smaller cars. But, what he isn't factoring in is Tesla's incredible AI driven safety features which are always looking out for him and helping to prevent any mishaps between him and the CT. That should earn it a big thumbs up from him."
"My whole issue with almost all of the new breed of EVs is their weight. EVs are all promoted for being ""environmentally friendly"", yet all the new EVs are huge, heavy, and wasteful vehicles that are just a waste of resources on all fronts.
As for each feature, drive by wire is fine; however, variable steering rates have been going on in the industry for long time. Bullet proof panels are just extra weight that one would pay every single meter they drive it."
"I mean for the fingerprint issue, you can get channel sponsor Dbrand for a new wrap, lol"

"The fanboy is oozing from this video. Ignoring the massive safety issues, spending so much time on a couple features while glossing over the problematic ones, and ignoring the implications of basically shouting to the world ‚ÄúI still like Elon Musk‚Äù by driving one of these. Pretty disappointing to see."

D-Brand it
It's 100% probably going to be featured in Cyberpunk in future for a lot of eddies.
intro is sick
"I'd love to see what CT would do with race rated tires as well where it wouldn't be torque limited for traction. Rearview mirrors used to be for reversing. Ever since the mandatory cameras, I've never gleaned at one until someone was tailgating, which only added to the stress of driving. Never once have one fail to work. Don't understand that complaint."
"Didnt know the panels are steel. Very safe for the driver, you could prolly drive straight through a house at higway speed"
"Steer by wire is one of the most dangerous things modern cars can have, what the feature does is honestly good, but modern cars have so much electronics and the same amount of electronics that fail constantly, if the steering fails at 150 you might as well start praying. 

Stainless steel on cars is terrible, there are good reasons why none makes cars out of it, Stainless steel oxidises, which forms a layer over the metal when reacting to oxygen, but here is the thing, it stains really quickly due to the oxidising process, that film is also destroyed by about any and all detergents, your hands, long exposure to moisture, dirt, grimes. So basically doing anything with the truck besides having it in a climate controlled dry room will make the thing rust. Hence, why nobody besides a couple ever used stainless steel. Stainless Steel is one of the most baffling decision they ever made."
"This should be banned. Its not even legal in europe because it kills pedestrians. How heavy it is makes it a danger to other drivers, and who the hell needs it to be that fast? In europe youd meed a semi truck license to even drive it. So many things to hate about it, not including that its electric so uses tons of harmful chemicals to make the battery that cant be recycled."
Thank you for teaching people about fast Vs quick

"Americans and their idea of ""performance"". 0-60 and quarter mile races. Both mean nothing. (Except to Americans)"
most iconic rusted car I have ever seen
"Fiat 500, Volkswagen Beetle, Citroen 2CV, the original Mini; 'iconic' and 'mass produced' do not have to be mutually exclusive, but there has to be something about a vehicle to make it so. I'm not sure (yet) if the Cybertruck has whatever that  'it' is. Saying that I like the styling, and could imagine a small coupe or roadster with the same look (but maybe different bodywork materials) being the icon the Cybertruck wants to be."
It is unique!
"This is possibly the worst looking vehicle I have seen released by a mainstream manufacturer... of all time.
I love innovation, but this aint it"
Ugliest vehicle going
I thing Lexus got first with the steer by wire thing. I don't remember the specific model though
Been such a big fan for a long time. But think you‚Äôve now jumped the shark. Now more than ever it‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôve gotten too big to actually be objective. For fear of access to future product getting cut. And that‚Äôs a shame.
"What I dislike about the Cybertruck's look is that I actually agree with the style. However, it just seems underdeveloped, premature, like they settled on an early draft before getting to that iteration that would actually look cool while still unleashing the same aggressive minimalism on the world. Maybe it wouldn't have the same shock value and polarizing effect, which is obviously intentional, but it could draw way more attention with actual efficient beauty."
"Do you know anything about the safety of crashes, because i dont think the crumple zone works that well"
"11:52 Towing isn't a monolith, it's a spectrum. The CT does not suck at towing. Sure, if you regularly drive 1k mi with 10k lb behind you, maybe it's going to be more of a pain than you'd like due to range/charging (like all EV trucks are). But if you take the boat to the dock occasionally, or are a plumber that hauls a trailer for your jobs locally, the CT is exceptional."
thats a sick introoo
the buletproof part is the best feature for an american made car wdym
"I'm not even a Tesla fan, but I find it funny when people go on about how ugly this car is when 99% of trucks on the road are ugly AF."
"It's the same as going for a run naked by the high street. Of course everyone will look at you, but ""iconic""? The only memorable thing about that monstrosity is the grifting around it."
looks cool and all but this thing is dangerous as hell and sadly rusts

"I still dont get it with the Porsche. Feels like the editing they did is misleading, as far as i understood the Porsche will be faster after 8miles. But in their ad the truck is overtaking it just before the finish line, which cannot be correct, right?!"
No one but marques seeing the ad and be like hmm I can also test cyber truck vs a 911 üòÇ
"More like Cybercringe, yeeesh. Markus fell down hard from his humble beginnings."
"It's a very American car. Americans love big trucks (without actually needing them), Americans go in straight lines a lot(due to street design), Americans needs their car to be bulletproof and American don't really mind all the safety issues. 

The entire concept just doesn't work anywhere else."
"it has no crumple zone, too dangerous for people in and outside the truck in case of accident."
Great work. Fantastic.
"feels like elon musk drew this design himself and force his workers to build it, cuz this is horrible looking"
"7:30 ""You'll be fine"", nah, the steel pannels might be fine, but cars have crumple zones for a reason, so with a cybertruck, if you get in an accident, your car will seem fine but your organs will be reduced to mush. Great"

"7:28 it pisses me off how even one of the most genuine tech youtubers out there is evading the fact that the cybertruck is NOT roadsafe. There is a reason why cars crumble in crashes, to minimize the impact on the ones inside it."
"I'm not a car guy, so this might not be a thing people ask but why do people buy these?

Is it just for the aesthetic? For the collection? For the hype? Cause you're obviously not buying it to use it as an actual truck lol
I understand collecting things and being interested in them, strange to do that with things as expensive as this but if you have the money I suppose.

I guess my question is: Is it just a hobby for rich people?"
Never understood why they don't wrap it free from the factory.. just a clear wrap would be perfect.
"it is iconic , it is the worst and ugliest car EVER hahaha"
Ugliest vehicle ever created
"The comparison between the beast cybertruck and the 911 was my favourite part of this video; it was well narrated . Who would have thought that the beast cybertruck was quicker than the 911, but the 911 is faster than the cybertruck. Good job, MKBHD."
14:00 damn that camera work and intro into the porsche was absolutely brilliant - love it!
"Very nice review, I've seen a hundered reviews of this fridge but I needed this one so badly, Tnx Marques"

"I‚Äôd love to get one, but I could never afford that. I‚Äôd love one though, looks amazing"
Any car design that has both positive and negative views regarding design is a plus. Making everyone happy is not the way to make anything iconic
"Great! If you get into an accident, the other person dies"
"Cybertruck is such ""a piece of tech"" it's fully reviewed in mkbhd instead of autofocus.."
"I love how 1. He completely ignored how unsafe this thing is for both the driver and any pedestrians in the event of an accident 2. He gives a free pass to them for production issues for $100,000 product and 3. He has the audacity to look at the design choices in the same vein as the Lamborghini Countach and call it iconic. 

This sounds like an ad"
"The part you talked about how when there will be more of these trucks produced people will probably be less excited when seeing one, it‚Äôs the same here in Israel. When Tesla started shipping cars here I was pretty excited every time I saw one but now it‚Äôs just normal."
I thought the most dangerous thing was the bulletproof windows when underwater
so when is it going matte black
Comment if you could have just rented a Uhaul instead of buying a pickup.
I think this design pattern will eventually make it into the mainstream.
If it had rounded edges it‚Äôd damn near look like a iPhone 2G
"""Stronger than regular glass"" üíÄ"
PT Cruiser and the SSR are unique cars that will always stay in my mind. The PT Cruiser cuz it was a car out of the 70s but today
"To me, this is the most ""fuck everyone else"" design ever. It's all about division, superiority, tribalism. A big middle finger to everyone else on the road, especially bikes and pedestrians, but also other cars. It is opposed to almost everything I stand for and to how I conduct myself daily."
How fast you can go on US Streets legally? More then 200 mph? So in Germany it makes sense to own a FAST car. In USA you can't ride for few hours more then 200mph.  So you don'z need a fast car. You have the change your stupid street law. Everything under 200 mph is üêå üòÇüòÇüòÇ
... and it's worse for the environment than most ICE sedans
"It is really frustrating to see that Tesla is judged with another standard. You bought a 60k production-ready car, not a beta tested car. 

And where is the safety side of the review? That thing is not safe to ride for anyone, not the driver, not the others drivers."
Great review
9:10 VERY RARE Elon Musk W. Wow. Exotic even
"Just remember: 


It'll never be enough."
Is this a re-upload of the same video from your autofocus channel?
"It's polarizing but my initial thoughts were it was a joke and it is hideous.  As I see it more and more out and about it reconfirms my initial thoughts.  The funny part is that 99% of the purchasers probably have no need whatsoever for a ""truck"".  As for people's behavior that's a direct result of its current rarity, but as they see it more and more that will change."
Marques should also become a car reviewer üíØüî•
"That car is just bs, I'm sorry."
Great video!  Always like hearing your take on the new autos
Is it actually ugly? Yes. Undoubtedly yes. Without question yes. Being used to how ugly it is doesn't make it less ugly.
Seeing Marques race for the first time is legendary.
"The iconic thing depends on how much ppl fall in love with the looks of the car.
Impala, Mustang, etc are all production cars with millions made and everyone would still jump at the opportunity to buy one if they can afford it"
You trucks for those times you need them ... even if it's once a year ... that's enough to justify it ... I only use the tray a few times a year ... and the towbar 1 or 2 times .. and I'd never go back to a sedan again !
"Would be iconic to not be so destructive, like the cybertruck is. Its only one word: dangerous. No word from MKHB about the boot cutting of fingers with its razor sharp metal without ANY SENSORS to protect you while its closing? 0.00000/10 product."
Reminder: iconic doesn't automatically mean the object is good or great
Bro's intro is getting really good day by dayüëΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I am leaving this comment here so that after some hours, days, weeks, months or years when someone likes or comment on it, I will be reminded to watch this video again"
It's like  the hummer but the hummer  was always hated
... and it costs a FORTUNE to repair ... and so the INSURANCE IS ASTONOMICAL !
"12:03 ""They know , WE know it sucks at towing"" but their marketing was showing the CyberTruck be great at towing???"
This truck should be in Mad Max movie rather than real life
Is it me or does he sound like he‚Äôs trying SUPER hard to make this sound good. A bit cringe at times
once i was moving a Lamborghini Diablo GT from a place to another (i was was a car salesman) than i parked on the road to go buy a water bottle. after one second i hear a BOOOM  so i get out immediately and on the other side of the road a guy with a bmw crashed on the car ahead because he was watching the  Diablo so i perfectly understand the reactions
Loved this review.
Love all your videos and this one was no exception. Keep up the great work sir!!
So .. ANOTHER Tesla lacking any design talent
The revving noise of the Porsche vs the electric whining of the Tesla üòÖüòÖüòÖ
"To my understanding, the classification of iconic follows many years later.

Makes you wonder sometimes what is going on in USA. Seeing a certain car is like peak excitement in their lifetimes? And this is a mass produced vehicle. And then almost half a video focusing on such temporary reactions

What i don't understand, is how is this allowed to be street legal in USA. Unlucky driver or pedestrian who is in crash with a tank. What if two cyber trucks crash with each other and both don't break apart to absorb the energy? Are we going back to the middle ages of cars?"
"Having only seen it in pictures i think it looks cool, very unique."
"A cyclist was an asshole to you? Who would have thunk? Great video as always. Love you, love Elon, but that drag race commercial straight up LIED. So intensely lame that they did that, super unnecessary too. Glad to see you went the _extra mile_ to call them out on it."
Maybe they just filming You
"The production, shots, everything is leveled up on this video! Amazing work everyone"
"Appreciating the German Frisbee Shirt, Marques!"
Great Shirt while standing near the whiteboard! Greetings from Germany!!!
"Imagine somebody hack your car, lock the doors and drive you into a river."
"As a concept vehicle it‚Äôs definitely iconic but I think it should have stayed in concept. Anywhere with pedestrian safety regulations this will be driven out of town and with EuroNCAP introducing infotainment safety standards (trying to eliminate screens where possible) this has 0 chance outside of its home market. Essentially it‚Äôs an iconic failure, much like the Delorean"
19:45 I see it üëÄ
"The cybertruck towing the 911 also had camera angle trickery to even get it to win the 1/8 mile. The cybertruck is way ahead of the 911 at the start about double the distance it wins with at the 1/8 mile, but cos of the camera angle and tracking it looks like they're both at the starting line. That's why you don't get any top view from the race like with your video. Elon making shit up as usual and needing a whole lot of fuckery to get it to look like it works. Classic conman tactics"
I'm SO glad the cybertruck isn't coming to Australia. I'll stick to my Toyota HiLux thank you very much.
Wow! I‚Äôm just amazed by the production quality of this video! You guys outdid yourselves this time!
lmao that one shot at the drive through was hilarious
Feel like I've had that intro in his videos beforeüòÖ
VW beetle. Leyland Mini
"I'm a brit. I've been to France, Germany and Hungary.

We have buses. We have semis and lorries. We have the Hymer Starclass(!).

All are much bigger than the CT.

And as for safety? Ask a London cyclist how they feel about Lamborghini.

So no, there is no, repeat NO reason for the CT not being available in the UK/EU except the fossil fuel industry telling them ""rocket man bad."""
All Porsche fans including me were offended üòÇ
Iconic or Ionic? ü§îüôÑ‚ú®

This is just the ultimate manhood compensator of all time
"I havent seen that many people hate on the design. Not sure what comments you are reading, but from what I see, people think this vehicle looks badass, most of them at least!"
"19:02 no, thats horrifying, scary, and completely unnecessary. Fatalities from car crashes have been getting worse in the last 10nyears after decades of slowly falling."
"The reaction that the cybertruck got from people on the street is what Mustang, Charger, and Challenger drivers imagine they get."
"Iconic, because it's such a eyesore and awful meme. It's the embodiment of the stereotype of ""obnoxious American"" but in car form, including the crap build quality and half-baked features."
I think they r watching u rather than cybertruck
Crazy how all of you geniuses don't know about window cleaner and microfiber towels

"It would look better in black.
Also I saw many militarily versions in renderings.. they look really dope"
"i hate elon must, but it's actually my taste. I've liked it since day one despite people around me thinking it's weird. For me it's not the kind of design that takes time to get used to like the apple bt earphones."
Love to have one
Goes to show that the cyber truck 2 will be a banger. IF the crash tests for that future car make sense
"Still reminding everyone that Adam Something‚Äôs CT video covers everything you need to know about that fragile mind‚Äòs ridiculous pet project. Well made video though, as always."
sick intro bro
How is this deathtrap even allowed on the road?
"Now, this comment does come from a place that does not own any Tesla, but what you describe as ""minimalism"" just  sounds like Tesla cutting corners"
Ending on the pt cruiser for the cyber truck is crazy
This video does not feel like a review
The cybertruck looks amazing but the matte black everything guy should've figured out how to make it look perfect
It is an unnecessarily dangerous pedestrian and cyclist destroyer. Period.
Already iconic or already rusty?
They  forgot  to put a roof on it
Dude it must've hurt so much buying this thing when you're making yet ANOTHER video about this box that's banned everywhere in the world
"Marques I love ya ,,i m sure we all love ya, 

my humble opinion,, when it comes to Car's. EV or not EV, sedan, or SUV, coupe or sports back or a freakin hatchback, please, when it comes to cars, leave it to or no Tech, please please please leave it Doug"
Stop reviewing cars lol
"Iconic? hardly. Never liked the design, just like the model 3 design but for the total opposite reasons. 

One is efficient but mind-numbingly bland, and the other is ""futuristic"" (not really) but so impractical.

The Cybertruck is neither iconic, nor classical or timeless. It will age like milk, IMHO."
Absolutely excellent review and discussion. The drag racing video with the cyber truck preparing to punch it gave me goosebumps
I like it's simplistic look. This is what i'd imagine far future cars to look like anyway.
"Guys, get over it. Cyber truck is a success.
Elon :1
Woke liberals :0"
The choice to go matt black on the porche was biblical üò©
Are you working on a pixel 8 review?
Cybertruck launching before GTA VI. Guess there's still glory left in this world.
"Allot of work went into this video, thank you guys!"
Great Video i love the look of the cybertruck and which Apple Watch Ultra Band are you wearing?
The finger chopping bonnet is underrated!
I loved the design the moment I saw it years ago.
The biker probably was blinded by the idiotic headlights on the cybertruck that point straight into your eyes. Don't be an idiot and make sure your lights are not blinding oncoming traffic!
"imagine if Apple said ‚Äòoh yeah the first few weeks of making an iphone, the screen might stick out or call off, that‚Äôs just how it is until we learn how it works‚Äô."

i like this critical marques! keep on!!
PT Cruiser Prowler is really iconic
"7:29 But will I be fine? With the car not giving in in accidents, where does the energy go? My guess is that the drivers of Cybertrucks are more likely to be severely injured in accidents, at least of those compared to other trucks - since the car does not give in, the people inside will. There's a safety reason too for us not building cars as durable as in the 1960'-1980's."
"Iconic is just the right word, over the years I've come to realise that people don't like new stuff, like change I mean, the form factor of a truck has been there for years, and tesla is trying to change that and I think that's the reason for that man's thumb down, but on the bright side, it's a way forward to the yet unknown future, and that's a thumbs up from me too, so, ICONIC, hell-yeah!!!"
"if it‚Äôs not a tank, and it definitely isn‚Äôt, stopping only small bullets has everything to do with marketing and nothing to do with safety. if someone was going to shoot at you in this, they are simply going to pick a more deadly weapon"
"It would be great to see this car on Indian roads, Its only competition would be trucks.üò∂‚Äçüå´"

Gonna be honest this sounds more like an Ad for the cybertruck instead of review
"23:50 the reason he gave thumbs down is that you would kill him with that ""car"""
God the intro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!‚ù§
"Its a disgusting billionaire/5 year old brain child of a ""car"". Basically using spaceX's cheap stainless steal boards, and fabricating a monstrously ugly ""car"". Really, this crosses so many common sense, its ought to be banned."
the problem is ultimately Elon
Most mass produced iconic cars didn‚Äôt cost 100k and have plastic interior so‚Ä¶
26:50 PT cruiser one of the worst cars I've ever driven. I takes $300 dollars just to find the engine by a mechanic.
"I‚Äôd rather have even the entry level 911. I get that this truck is divisive and beauty is subjective, but I‚Äôll never warm to way this thing looks. Clever marketing campaign from Tesla imo, it keeps the brand in the spotlight. It does seem impressive from an innovation perspective, but there are certain trends in Teslas that make me less likely to buy one in the future, especially the steering yoke, and swapping indicator/blinker stalks for buttons. Nope, not interested! In changing something i‚Äôve been used to for 25 years of driving. I guess that makes me a boomer, but I am who I am."
Wait Marques :D Why you wear a shirt from a german frisbee sport association? :D I was like. Huh isn¬¥t that our flag?!

Will you make a video on the Xiaomi SU7 ? I would love to see a video about the Xiaomi car
There's no doubt that if you want to be the coolest dude on the road right now drive this. Or maybe a Dukes of Hazard replica Charger or Knight Rider Kitt car but this if you want to be cool and show that you're cashed up.

17:25 it's not clever it's literally lying
Cybertruck is banned in the UK as it fails crash standard's
Tesla doesn't give a fuck if this truck is a success or not. They've got people talking about it. This is just a marketing stunt.
"thanks again, Marques, for showing that you literally have no clue about cars"
I‚Äôd been following MKBHD for years. And this is one of the best videos I seen.  Hands down 10/10
use dbrand skin to remove the fingerprint
"As a European this kind of car astonishes me. Bulletproof?? Huge truck capable of accelerating faster than a sports car? Very fast steering? This looks so dangerous, and unnecessary. Now I'm not saying all Americans would drive this and all Europeans drive small cars, but the cultural difference is kind of a shock - it's the most over the top, ridiculous and dangerous truck I've ever seen."
"6:46 We all thought he was going to get a gun out of the truck bed, didn't we?"

"cybertruck is just a marketing stunt, nothing else. It does nothing that other pickups cant do and it is dangerous af. Musk promised 800km range, but it got only like 400km. He promised that the chassis would be one piece, but it isnt and is made like normal other cars. The interior is very bad and cheaply made. There are no phsical buttons on the dashboard so you have to do everything through the display, which causes you to not pay attention to the road in front of you. Also, the front of the car is angled in a way that if you hit some pedestrian with it, the pedestrian goes under the car instead of over the car and over the roof. It is a dangerous thing. Also, it has near zero crumple zones so if you hit someone, your car stays in the same shape. This is a problem because first, when you hit a normal car, the car will be shredded no matter what. second of all, if you hit another cybertruck, both drivers will be dead because both cars will stop instantly without any gradual slowing down. Also, this car rusts af, the panels are not aligned so if you hit someone with the side of your truck, you literally cut them like a sausage. The truck bed is small and generally it does a bad job of being a pick up"
Lets pray this tank will never make it to Europe üôè
19:44 You are damn correct. Cars should have had 48V or at least 24V (like big trucks) system like decades ago. Old car manufacturers stick to the old.

"Great video! Not just the conent (which is excellent as usual) but the way that you guys structured the story telling and theme of the what was being shown. This really stood out to me, so I had to comment on it. And you got me thinking about the ""iconic""  nature of this vehicle and the first thing I thought of was the Herman Miller Aeron chair; a mass-produced product that has iconic design that stands out for its simplicity and has also stood the test of time. Thanks for making this."

"I'll simplify this for you MKB, think of the aesthetic as what you see on a high fashion runway. It's ""interesting"" but will never be mainstream.

"You are on good terms with Musk and I get that you don't want to jeopardize this relationship, but this video is obviously very biased.

I agree that it's an iconic car, yes. That being said, it's not iconic because it's rare, but because it's very different and, crucially, very controversial.

It's not a good car, if you look at it as a tool to get something done. As was pointed out, most people don't use trucks to do truck things, they drive them on paved roads in town. Now what's the problem with that?

1. It's heavy, big and tall. Maybe not as big as an F150, but the same problems are still there. It will absolutely annihilate pedestrians in a crash, especially due to the terrible design of many US roads. It will also kill people in other, normal cars, that could've survived if both parties drove similar vehicles. And it will wear out streets and increase maintenance cost much more than a lighter car.
In short, these types of vehicle are bad for everyone and everything except the person driving, and being fine with that is a bad attitude to have.

2. It is made from steel. The rain breaks it and it will corrode. This car is made for California and Texas, but live in a colder, rainy or humid area and it will not survive being outside for extended periods of time.
Or you could buy the extra coating for a few thousand bucks to make it corrosion resistant. What the heck.

3. Normal people don't care for fast acceleration. It's dangerous in real world road situations and makes people behave like douchebags.

All of that brings me to the conclusion that it is a bad car. It's a good status symbol, if you need this for your ego, but it sucks for everyone else on the road.
If you want a car that's good at doing stuff a truck was initially intended to accomplish and that fits actual, real use cases, get a Mitsubishi Fuso Canter."
That intro>>>ü•µüî•
"The issue is the competition is closing the gap fast, this is not ionic, I do not think you will see this in Europe as I do not think it will pass safety standards, which includes the safety of pedestrians who you might hit! - quick and fast - yes speed of light, but round a track üòÇ"

"My take is the Cybertruck is for people with a lot of money to waste. Good for them, though if i won the lottery, it‚Äôs definitely not in my shopping list. And i absolutely love tech, but no Apple carplay alone is a big disappointment without adding all the other issues. The low poly design, again not attractive to me, give me smooth soft curves."
That intro was dope
"does being iconic actually means that it is a good product/car/truck?

Delorean (ironacally the only other stainless steel car ever produced) is without a doubt iconic, but ask anyone who owned it if it is a good car..."
Its iconic in the same way Homer Simpsons car is
"Been hearing that the heavier weight of electric vehicles like this causes rapid tire wear. Not sure what the math is if there's a notable difference on how much more it would cost you in tires over the lifetime of the vehicle. Probably negligible but I'd imagine tires for the Cyber truck are highly priced. 
  Cool truck though, I'd have one. That said, I think hydrogen is gonna over take electric cars real soon, Toyota is making massive strides with hydrogen and we are talking 800+ miles to a tank full."
How does someone reconcile the labor practices and environmental impact of battery sourcing?
It's what you get when someone with asymmetrical intelligence designs a Truck. Genius engineering styled by a twelve year old.

millions of people?
Lexus rz has similar steering
"It looks like a high tech, stainless steel trash can. Highly overpowered garbage truck"
"Yes, Tesla knew what the buyers of the Cybertruck prioritized: people looking at them. üôÑ"
The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is that it did not pass the European Safety Regulations for cars.
I bet a lot of the negative comments are EV haters no matter the vehicle.
4:49 doesn't lexus try it earlier?
Never a truer group of words said Mr. Brownlee. In fact i uttered similar words before you even made your statement.
"The only pro is that people look at it and buy into the hype. It's a disaster in all other aspects, be it pedestrian safety, stopping distance, sharp edges, rusting, discoloration, repair. Please stick to tech, cause the lack of automotive knowledge is apparent. Also, ""seemed"" like a paid piece for Tesla."

Cybertruck is not legal in EU because it kills whatever it hits.
"you only get ""icon"" status if you do it for years and represent a lifestyle or something special... at the moment it's just a hyped car with some obvious flaws..."
The cybertruck is dope but I think a review on the canoo pick up truck will be useful
"The cybertruck is a true reflection of the dissonance we are in with a dystopian yet advanced future. It‚Äôs a stonehead‚Äôs fleeting idea, regurgitated after a sci-fi movie marathon."
"It's trash. As iconic as the Zune. If you feel this monstrosity will fill a gap in your life, you need to work on yourself."
W  intro!!!!
"No, not iconic, just cheap manufacturing design for lowering costs."
"The title should be: ""The Tesla Cyber truck review: Already rusted"""
Tesla Cybertruck must be one of the most american thing ever. in good and a bad way.
"one of the least honest reviews i've seen on the cybertruck. The mental gymnastics to justify the super glaring flaws the truck has which directly contradict statements from Tesla, makes it even worse. To be honest, I understand not wanting to anger the brand, but i hope it's worth it having lost all credibility for a lot of your viewers. I'm not angry or anything but genuinely sad and disapointed."
Brilliant videography as always!!
"Well  Marques, i  believe  this video is one of  the best  you  ever  made,  both  in  the storytelling but as well the  picture ! congratulation  to you and the team."

"I think the Truck looks interesting and feels like a cool product to get as more of a collectible, a second or third car for wealthy people. But as a daily driver for the masses? It‚Äôs just not a safe or sane vehicle - especially for everyone outside the car.. (tbf this applies to basically all trucks, the Cybertruck just is a little bit more insane, because of weird material and design choices..)"
"Excellentüëå Highs, Lows, Info and Jokes. I can honestly say I was entertained and well informed. More? Yes please ‚ù§"
The irony is that the quality of production of this video is inversely proportional to the quality of production of the product
"I don't know what you call it in English but in the EU we have a zone in the car that is called the ""Knautschzone""(German), the cybertruck does not have a big enough Knautschzone and is therefore not allowed in the EU, because it is too dangerous.
That's why we don't have any cybertrucks in Europe."
"A Tesla is a Tesla, it can never be a Ferrari or any of the greatest cars of all time. Those brands mastered and pushed automobile engineering to the next level. But, the Cybertruck is just an undercooked shortcut with Software magic that can never compete with real refined mechanics of a Ferrari or Bugatti etc."
"I was already convinced it was iconic the day it was announced. Even though my views on Musk has soured, and I'm not a fan of trucks and I do think this truck is dumb in multiple ways, there is no denying that it's iconic. Nothing else publicly available looks remotely close to this and nobody would be dumb enough to burn millions of dollars to put this out there. Elon you're dumb, but thanks I guess for this one dumb thing

Edit: note on iconic, I also think the Rivian trucks are iconic. For me, in the sense that it was widely reported upon, but it wasn't widely mass produced (yet?). So when I when I saw one driving around in my area, far from a big city, I was surprised. Same with old Teslas, when I saw my first one in Texas in 2012 I was stunned."
Is this video sponsored by Tesla??
"The original Mini was Iconic.

Im pretty sure not many people can afford a hundred thousand dollar sports truck. So ct will be kinda rare for a while on the street
15:24 Not the first time I see a guy breaking down a vehicle's performance in front of a whiteboard like this.
It really looks like a lot of effort went into this video..... loved every second of it!
I just love MKBHD‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüñ§
You talk about durability but fail to mention the rusing issue?
People would be looking at you the same way if you were driving a tiny clown car with balloons.
So another paycheck from Tesla.... This is getting boring . No man in his right mind will spend his money for this trash car üòÇüòÇ
"do you want a Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari or a Cyber Truck ?..... Umm, there's your answer.... One little problem it needs CarPlay... Please CarPlay would be nice."
"All right, this is quality editing... cinematography top notch. Feels like a Nolan film, or Celine Song, or Denis Villeneuve... you get the point."
"Extremely irresponsible to say ""if someone hits you, you'll be fine. You'll be fine"" the rigidity of the stainless steel body means the force isn't being absorbed by crumple zones in the car and is instead goes to your body meaning you're more likely to be injured 7:30"
"If you got 10.995 for the quarter of a mile, how are they quoting <11s in the video? 

Is that designed to make you think it's sub 11 *whilst towing*?"
Stainless Steel Gets RUST PIMPLES than actually Rusting .
The PT cruiser point hit hard. But I'm sure cos the cyber truck looked forward(futuristic) and not backwards it might become the new normal rather than fade to the back
"Everybody commenting about mass-produced iconic things isn‚Äôt getting what he‚Äôs trying to say. He‚Äôs talking about something starting off being iconic, not something that became iconic through mass production and widespread adoption after its release."
"I'm not a fan of steel or aluminium outside, I think it's a thing of the past and needs to be changed, Why not like a human body? If I had Elon money to build a car I would make the skeleton steel and crash safe as possible and everything outside plastic (the skin) quality plastic/carbon fiber. It would make the vehicle not only more robust but you can easily repair parts by just replacing the damaged part If only the skin is damaged, also the car would feel much more warm during Winter time."
how many cybertruck videos can you make?
Honestly it still looks shit. The design is bad. It hasn't grown on me since the day I regretfully laid eyes on it.
"Really hoping that you post an actually honest review of this monstrosity.

This review wasn't it."
MKBHD's Elon driding is annoying
"I‚Äôm more and more sure that most of the design decisions with the exterior were made because it‚Äôs a very quick, cheap and easy shape to create."
"I've heard the same argument about people driving stupid to take pictures from car influencers with fancy sports cars in crazy colors and with crazy bodykits. I think for the cybertruck it will go away soon, once a lot of them are on the street."
"If you ignore the fact that cybertruck is a high-tech vehicle, it would be easier to see that that look is actually very cheap and crappy, like just some home-made, cheap, bended stainless sheets. So, yes it is ugly."
"I just don't get it.
You will be safe? ----> Cybertruck Crash Test is HORRIFYING"
"PT Cruiser or Veyron are still cars. Cybertruck is not a truck or device, it's a statement."
For me props to Elon for making something different. Let‚Äôs face it the cars like marmite (you either love it or hate it) but most affordable cars on the road all look the same. All the same body design give or take.  I like this motor but I also like marmite üòÇ
I wonder how well the jaws of death do ü§î
Ugly car. Not watching.
Iconic and oxidising
"Head turns in 7M Lamborghini ‚ùé
Head turns in Cyber truck ‚úÖ"
"Up to 9mm, you do know people carry bigger round guns than 9mm right?"
usually your reviews rare very detailed and you can so no bias but anything to do with tesla is a little annoying at this point. Can see a clear bias towards them but i can understand you want to keep a good relationship with them but as a viewer its not great.
A highly useless car that is by no means environmentally friendly.
Putting on a crash helmet with the visor down.ü§£ü§£ü§£
Robocop on the move
Those Tesla cars are death traps.
The irony of a cybertruck having a door that wasn't installed properly - should we blame Tesla's DEI polcies? üôÉ
That's absolutely not the most dangerous thing about it lol
marques weren‚Äôt messing when he said this might be the best video they‚Äôve ever made‚Ä¶
There are so many ads in this video it ruins it.
"Steer by wire - it was introduced to make automated driving cheaper.
Now you don't have to spend on strong motors that turn the steering wheel.

Cons-
Hackers.
You no longer have control."
I can answer the question easily. It is not iconic neither is any of the teslas. Americans love them but the rest of the world does NOT care about them. As a european i can say that vast majority of population hates them and looks down on them.
Landrover is the only brand that will properly off road with every model.
"Steer by wire, could that be dangerous?
In case of failure you would completely loose the control of the car"
The intro sequence went SO HARD
how is drift on cyber truck ?
"0:57 Is that supposed to say ""Cybertruck""? ü§î"
Should get another one and keep it on ice for 20-30 years.
cybertruck  is still on its first version eventually it will get fast not only quick
Maybe the cyclist gave you the thumbs down because he knows that if the cybertruck hits him he is 99.9% dead and that‚Äôs the problem with modern car design. Bigger and taller front bumpers.
"The BMW i8 is most iconic, can you do a review on that car??"
Seen a matte black one in the bay.. wrapped .. it was super dope
"steer by wire also looks insanely unreal if look at the steering wheel and see the enviromant move in your peripheral vision 6:11
6:50 did he throw a hammer or did the hammer throw him xD"
"love your videos Marques, but I just HATE feets... Can you please add sensible units like meters"
"Okay but this video is iconic, the production quality is so good"
its nothing but an over rated failure for people with fragile egos
"6:48 the way he gave up after the first hitüò≠

But to me the steel isn't overrated because that's one of it's main selling points"
Kudos to your animator! Very nice video.
"Iconic and mass produced is not a contradiction. Need I say VW Beetle? Actually, even Ford Model T.
Oops, just see someone else commented the same thing üòâ"
"It's not iconic, it's a prototype that made it to production without refinement."
14 20 man like milesüòÇ
Hot take: Tesla‚Äôs UI and OS is so good that nobody should ever find themselves thinking they miss being able to use Carplay or Android Auto. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"As a european, cars like this are just insane. This thing wouldn't even fit through some of our streets, would definitely not fit in normal parking spots, and would be illegal just on how unsafe it is for other road users. And americans buy it just to go grocery shopping? Why on earth would you want that?"
"Ah yes, the most dangerous thing about this multi-ton, sharp edge, steel pedestrian killer is... other people. It's beyond me how some Americans are so deep into car dependency and can look at this vehicle without thinking ""What in the world went wrong for this abomination to end up on our streets.""
Shoutout to the biker giving you a thumbs down for one of the most reasonable takes in this whole video."
CT1 ??
The first 30 seconds are like the opening of the wire üòÇ
7 minutes of Marques justifying his Porsche LMAO
"Right now i see the novelty and i would probably take a pic too if I would ever see it here in Europe but once the novelty wears off i would actually pity everyone that made that financial decision. All the problems that come with this toy is not worth the price. What I would like that steer by wire will become more popular with this. For heavy duty/Larger vehicles first and maybe if it makes sense for smaller vehicles as well. 

Happy for everyone though that got one, just hope they are conscious that this thing is way more capable of killing someone in traffic that a Honda Jazz..."
Great review thank you
It's iconic because it broke the mold of what pickups were for the last 100 years.
first minute of the video looks like paid promotion.
"This videos format and the way he went from point to point was quite interesting, I enjoyed it quite a lot"
To be fair I drive a ton but I see one basically every day (Dallas)
These videos are just getting ridiculous! The content and production quality! ü´†
"27:15 I don't think cybertruck will ever ""fit in"", so I think it'll keep its status."
"Love the ""Deutscher Frisbeesprort-Verband e.V."" T-Shirt :)"
Is this a Tesla mouthpiece ?
"I think you steered clear of the safety aspect because this is actually its biggest issue. It being 'a tank' doesn't actually mean it's safe, there's a reason why we don't make cars out of super-hard materials and in this shape - it's not safe. Not for pedestrians, not for other cars, not even for the person who drives it.
There's a term called 'crumple zone' that describes a vehicle's ability to deform in order to absorb shocks and minimise the impact towards the people in the car. The 'tougher' the outside of the car is, the more it amplifies the impact force on the people inside.
That's why car makers have been making panels from light and thin materials for decades and it's been proven to be the safest way to build a car.
I'm happy this thing is not legal in Europe, it would be by far the most dangerous vehicle on the road."
How safe this is  for pedestrians?? I really want to know no one talks about it is there any rules or regulations in usa for pedestrians safety?  I am genuinely interested to know my American friends please enlighten me cheers
"Is it just me or does any one else think the space at the back is wasted ...

I mean instead of the angle ... It could have been horizontal. ...

Lots of luggage space wasted ....
Man and Material Maximum and Machine Minimum should be the design ..."
Need a cross country drive video comparing both Tesla and Rivian when you go to attend  the next apple event.
Now talk about the lack of crumple zones !?
I'm curious to know what would happen to a pedestrian if they were hit by a Tesla Cybertruck.
"It's a joke, it's ironic, not iconic. This looks like a car a child designed....  ü§£"
Any particular reason to use a whiteboard when you know you can very beautifully animate the same stuff?
"25:50 but I think that it will also help with its iconic status, people will actually see it."
My child üòÇ
It hurts my eyes
"That car isn't good looking and it's literally a piece of trash. The engineering might be on point, but the execution appears to be terrible overall. Being that dangerous to pedestrians as well as other cars and being ""street legal"" is still something I can't wrap my head around. 

Overall a piece of trash that is so ugly and unpleasant to see on the road, that people can't seem to be mesmerized by it. I'm pretty sure that if I make my car look like a giant turd, people would take just as many photos of it as they are of this piece of trash ""truck"". That doesn't really make it iconic though does it. It's like a car crash. You simply can't take your eyes off of it."
"Remember when Toyota released the Prius. Cameron Diaz, Leonard DiCaprio and Tom Hanks just to name a few who ""bought"" into the eco cool factor and rare at the time. But frankly the Cybertruck much more suited for Law Enforcement that civilians. Instead of seeing a Crown Vic in your rear view mirror just a stainless steel plate of the Cybertruck. Not sure how it would fair in an actual pursuit"
14:53 That sound..Jheeez!
The production on this video üî• my hat off to you guys
"Everyone in the comments touched on how subjectively ugly, and objectively dangerous this is. There is some cool tech under the hood, but I'm really confused on variable steering ratio. Did Tesla just put mouse acceleration on a steering wheel that is in charge of 3 tons of steel?"
Brilliant review of a fantastic vehicle. If they eventually do a smaller 5.3m long 2.05m wide one it will sell well in the U.K.
"Quick question: what happens if the car dies (like 0% battery or actually dead car) and you need to tow it? With the steering by wire you can‚Äôt move any of the wheels right? In the best scenario you can disengage the motors that drives the wheel left and right, but still, you don‚Äôt have any control of them. Am I missing something?"
It is iconic.
"MKBHD is the only person who hasn‚Äôt actually addressed the flaws of this obviously flawed car, I can understand you‚Äôre preserving the relationship with one of the wealthiest people in the world, I don‚Äôt think an honest review will go the way it has with him. Even tho you pointed out the bad panel joints. It being novel isn‚Äôt a positive it‚Äôs a reaction. Your job is to tell us how it applies"
Looks like Marques good a call from Elon after the last video üòÇ
Apparently there was a crash and the other car got totalled and Cybertruck was fine but the person in the totalled car was unhurt and the person in the truck got his legs broken. ( need to confirm. Twitter. )
You BEST video yet!!!
@4:54 there's also a Lexus that have steer by wire I believe
People who don't know who MKBHD is would probably don't know what the cybertruck is.
This is biased as hell
imagine dbrand for it ü•∏
13:43 that Hagerty esque intro to drag race!!!! I loved that!!
Cybertruck is beautiful ‚ù§
0 talk about it's safety
It runs on batteries and goes bust if it gets wet. Of course it isn‚Äôt.
"Marques I'm disappointed, not a single word about the stainless steel not being able to take any dirt on it, rusting, etc., that's an essential information you just left out.

Another thing that I don't understand is how reviewers never say anything actual negative about Tesla's (especially early) build quality. The panel gaps are humongous, the interior quality of a 1995 Golf Mark III, how is this okay for a car of this prize? Why is Tesla always getting a pass on this?

Performance - why are we still talking about this? Yes, its plain performance is insane, but why compare apples with oranges at all? You don't compare how often you can do those pulls with the Cyber Truck before it overheats, how often you can do it before the battery is empty, so why mention it at all? Also the quarter mile ""ad"" - that's actual misleading advertising. Only Tesla just gets a pass on this.

And last but not least - the missing features. Only a god damn Tesla gets a pass on basically being an unfinished beta version for full money. Ridiculous."
"Spoiler: regrettably its still a Tesla
And also looks as good as a PT cruiserüòÇüòÇ"
Being bulletproof in the US is definitely not overrated
Buy a van
It is just a hunk of junk.
11:30 People are stupid.
"My problem with the Cybertruck is this - it does everything its competitors do, but worse.  Just a car that hasn't matured."
"All the cars we laughed at are time, in hindsight were discovered to be ahead of their time."
It‚Äôs ironic that you don‚Äôt seem to understand what ‚Äúiconic‚Äù means.
"I can just hope this thing doesn‚Äòt make it to German streets; not because I am hating on it as a car, but as an absolute kill machine in every accident it will drive many more people to buy way too big cars for what they need, contributing to congestion, parking issues, and probably more deadly accidents. I hope they make a smart sized Tesla also, i.e. a car actually properly sized for individuals."

"I cannot help but see the beautiful production value of this video. It is amazing how far you have come. Its a beautiful work of art, Marques"
Who sent out the bat signal to the vee dub fan club in the comments section here? Sheeesh.
"Already Iconic? More like Already Moronic
amiright"
I think from a purely production view point this is a new high bar for a YouTube video. If I saw this from a massive studio on TV I‚Äôd be saying it‚Äôs a very clean next level review. But it‚Äôs on YouTube! Congratulations
He is just a tesla / rivian fan boy. Its a fact that it is over priced refrigerator.
Why do you keep pushing this thing on us
Cyber truck is so different that this isn‚Äôt a auto focus video ü§£
"I don‚Äôt think sales figures determine whether something is iconic or not.

I‚Äôd claim cars like the Volkswagen Beetle and Combi, the Ford Model T and the Mazda MX-5 are all ‚Äòiconic‚Äô, despite their high sales numbers.

Edit: I should read some comments before repeating what others have already said!"
I know that there are people who want that monster. Does anyone really need it though? What purpose does it serve that a smaller and safer car doesn‚Äôt?
"The Reliant Robbin was iconic, turned heads and was useless so once again Musk hasn't invented something new..."
Hopefully this will never be sold outside of the USA üá∫üá∏
I have a model 3 and I‚Äôm happy with it but I‚Äôm so glad this thing will never be released in Europe. It‚Äôs seriously dangerous for pedestrians :/ if you get hit by it you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs too high and and the hood doesn‚Äôt bend at all
"The Intro, so dope!!"
"I wonder if you drive 80km/h and moose jumps in front of car, are you hitting with ""smooth"" steering or what?"

Dope Intro üî•
NA Miata's are iconic and they were mass produced. Same with Classic Mini Coopers and VW Beetles.
Love the graphics on this video!
Was kinda expecting a continuity break when the hoodie went up but it's actually when it came down
"Didnt mention
- battery issues in the cold
- traction issues in dand and when going off road
- the eletric door on the front-trunk wont close of it detects resistence on the front , but not from the side.

Tesla also says you can be sued for re-selling the truck. Have fun."
"Marques is trying so hard to convince us that he likes this ""truck"" and so far the best thing he came up with it's that people look at it."
"Thumbs down from the biker must have been from the scenario where a rider hits one of those angles, not to say that hitting a round object is not going to hurt :))"
5:55 wild how good quality this footage is.
"I was born in 1942 and the is the most unusual and striking motor vehicle I‚Äôve ever seen. The Edsel was hyped to the moon and sank like a stone. I think the cybertruck will do just fine. On the Perth freeway yesterday I saw a purple Lamborghini which is one more than I‚Äôve seen purple cows. Yup, the Cybertruck is iconic and they will be remembered for a long time."
They need to be fully autonomous... what the heck happened to updates on that :/
the topspeed of the Cybertruck shoud be 130mph
"""If someone hits you, you'll be fine"" And what happens when this hits someone?"
Isn't Nissan do steer by wire few years ago? Lexus did too before the Cybertruck.
"for me the ""thumbs down"" reaction wouldn't really be about the Cybertruck.
As mentioned in the video, most people don't need a truck, and I will never understand why trucks are sooo popular in the US. Due to their size, shape and weight, trucks are almost always less efficient, no matter if EV or ICE."
It looks like a car designed by Homer Simpson.
I would wrap it
"3:00 when you imagine people not hearing about the car, and then seeing it irl, the reactions make a lot of sense."
Using a 3 ton truck as a daily vehicle just because it's labelled as a truck. Like spitting the environment in the face...
imagine having to use 5 minutes explaining why an ‚Äúappliance‚Äù is slower than a 911
Pretty sure that this car will disappear in the near future. It's a proof of concept
"Wow, your Top Gear experience is really coming up now...other creators should learn from you how you have re-invented yourself with time. I can see you surviving on YouTube for another decade and me watching you üòÄ"

Those roads are horrible
No way this shitbox will pass pedestrian crash tests
6:53 Seeing Marques slamming the Cybertruck with a hammer is hilarious and satisfying as the same time
"You buy it because its cyber , you dont buy it because its a truck ."
Me as a german is really hooked an ur german Frisbee Shirt ‚ù§
Only rich people tow
its a electric kinda truck.
"Tesla really needs to make a two-seater version of the cybertruck. Get rid of the back seats, extend the truck bed to give it more capacity and perhaps add a bit of internal storage space behind the front seats and add more battery capacity there too."
"Damn, the amount of hate CT receives on TikTok (and TSLA as a company on Threads, poor Dorsey‚Äôs orphans üòÇ) is incredible. I do not like SUVs, but this one makes me more inclined to buy one üòÅ"
What an intro üî•üî•
"I dont trust your contrnt anymore. You hang out with musk, he's given you personal interviews and cars, your house is literally built with and runs on elon musks company... I just don't trust your reviews anymore. It seems like you're afraid to say anything truly negative that'll piss off your friend. I no longer come to you for my impartial reviews."
"Lol ""My Child"" I know that feeling"
"Perfect design for sheep üêë from dictator lovers.

Nah The 2024 model 3 is better üíØ
"Modern cars are more ""fragiles"" compared to old cars because of the phisics of collisions. When a ball of billiards hits another one, the second one will take all of that energy to move. If you throw the same ball against an egg, it won't even move and it will breakon the spot. So in old times in an accident the cars would have not be that damaged BUT THE PEOPLE INSIDE WOULD HAVE. In modern times the car would break a lot more and that energy used to break it is dissipated and the people inside the car would be less hurt. This is why this stainless stell is bullshit. Sorry for my English"
"In the future in Europe, physical buttons are required. So we might see Tesla implement them."
"23:39 I think the reason the biker gave you a thumbs down was because the cybertruck isn't as safe to other people is they crashed (bikers, pedestrian) as the normal everyday vehicle with lots of crumple zone. the dudes in the car on the other hand don't care as much."
"Being iconic doesn't mean it's a good car, the 3 wheels car from top gear is iconic.
This feels like a waveform video btw."
"""A physical button is button, in a lot of ways, is better than a digital button"" - what?

I am pretty sure most buttons in cars are both physical and digital. i.e. they are physical in the sense they are not touch based but also digital in the sense they do not actually control the component directly in an analog manner.

If you press the ""increase fan speed"" button in a regular car, it does not directly affect the fan motor. Instead it sends a digital signal to some controller that interprets it.


Anyways I assume he meant to say people prefer physical buttons to touch-sensitive surfaces/buttons."
This was dope. Great job!!!
So much work done for this video I love it. I can imagine this must have been a lot of fun to plan and film :)
Looks like someone is trying very hard not to say how trash it is...the rust-truck
4:49 lexus was
This shows how badly Tesla needs a marketing and PR team. That will change the entire game for Teslas outreach to the masses who don‚Äôt know much about Tesla!
"On the aesthetics aspect: I think the back looks SICK. Better than the front, even though the front steals my heart with those inset headlights. But to my eyes the light bar on the front is just too THICC. I like the look of slim, sleek lightbars and the Cybertruck's front one just makes it look like a toy, not something from Bladerunner. But the back looks like the movie for sure. The side profile makes me puke tho honestly, that pointed roof is just so weird looking in my opinion. It's very american for sure, no elegance, just MASS. It's a massive vehicle. I get bothered by the A pillar width on my Nissans all the time, since the brand always designs unnecessarily thick A pillars, so I don't think I'd ever get used to the Cybertruck's, which is like twice the size üòÇ
I severely dislike wide A pillars, man."
You are wrong about Steer by Wire. Lexus has been doing that. There is a Real Engineering video about the Lexus too
tesla took over G-wagon market share
The way that CyberTruck takes off is insane!! Like that Porsche too! Dream dual garage!
"Such different. The ford Aerostar pickup. I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs harsh, it‚Äôs the Oldsmobile silhouette pickup."
"You're talking about being a beta tester as a normal thing. You don't talk about tesla telling you to f off with your problems until the car really breaks. And that's for a over 100k vehicle.

How about starting being with the people for once?"
But what about the rust??
love these videos despite personally driving a beaten up prius from 2004. nostalgia for top gear without having to deal with fucking Clarkson
It's clearly not iconic because hardly anyone has heard of it.
0:04 fin.

id still say the pt cruiser is iconic tho. but yeah not in the same way as a veyron

Great review though. Amazing how Tesla over engineered almost everything -- from looks to steering."
"Man just seriously compared a CYBERTRUCK to a pt cruiser, A FLIPPIN PT CRUISER!!! You've fallen off Marcus üôÑ"
"The biker probably gave you a üëé because, as a biker vs a truck, and one that has body panels as tough & sharp as the Cybertruck has, bikers stand NO chance... Being both a car driver and a motorcyclist, I understand the thinking behind that bikers thumb down gesture... üòè

"Correction: if your car is super rigid, your car will be ok. But not you. It's like soviet cars. They survive but not you."
"It's something like owning an iPhone or a Macbook. Six years back, I owned one, and people would ask me about it, want to use it for a while, and would love how it feels. Now, it's so common that 65-70% of the people I meet have an iPhone or a Macbook. ( at least in India )"
Damn i am on a crazy far island and i know a cyber truck. And i am not a car enthusiast üòÇ
"Ecologically, it's not fine. Millions of people moving unnecessarily a few extra tons of metal and batteries to do their groceries is not fine. It's physics, it doesn't matter how green your energy source might be it's just incredibly inefficient! And that's on top of the fact that the life cycle of the truck and its recycling will always have a considerable footprint. With the same amount of manufactured mass you could have 3 times the number of people doing their groceries plus one third of the required parking space."
"I'm from a time when a new car (not the cheapest) was less than $3k, so I know how I value a vehicle. I would expect a $100k vehicle to have a heads up display ... in front of the driver where it belongs."
Iconic & mass produced: Coke bottle

55k for the cheapest one ü§î

"I think give the Cybertruck a couple of years of fine tuning. 
Looking forward to it being in Australia."
How is it even possible to have not heard of the Cybertruck!?
i love how he needs to reassure after every critique since Elon is a baby and would take personal attack to him pointing out how stupid this truck is and how dishonest the marketing is.
"I'm gonna say No.
The DMC DeLorean is iconic. The Cybertruck is not."
I think it looks horrible and that Tesla lost a chance to make something stuning that would sell millions and wasted that....oh well
I really want to own one someday day. There is no other product like this
Funny how positive the reaction in real life is compared to the negativity you see in online comments.
"I think people who are saying ‚ÄòBeetle or 911 also mass produced and iconic‚Äô are kinda making his point, or maybe I misunderstood it. Yes those cars are also iconic but they would have been in rarified air if they made limited quantities of those. If there were only a 1000 beetles ever made we would probably pull out our phones today the moment we spotted them. Since they are mass produced we may turn our heads if we do see them but most don‚Äôt loose their minds when they spot one. Cybertruck has all the makings of such an iconic vehicle even if Elon said that are only going to produce let‚Äôs say 10k of them. So ppl might loose their minds now when they see it but it won‚Äôt be the case in the future."
I‚Äôm 71 and I love it and would have one in a heartbeat üíó
Watch this video on greyscale mode and its a freaking movie üçø

THAT INTRO WAS SO COOL!!!
"Production quality was Top tier 
Felt like watched a great documentary üí•üëå"
"It looks ""sci-fi"" to california 20-somethings who's intro to sci-fi was   AI generated slop."
Toyota BZ4X did it first with steer by wire system!!!
"Variable steering ratio has been a thing even w/o steer by wire.
I can't imagine not getting any feedback from the front wheels...

Also why do Americans think you need a truck for towing? You just need enough power and a good gearbox. 30 years ago my dad would tow a fully loaded caravan with a VW Transporter that had 75hp and 150lb-ft of torque. And generally here in EU we've been towing with our sedans since forever. Yes, you won't probably tow 10000lbs, but if 63% don't tow at all, I bet the ones who tow 10000lbs are in the single percentage digits.

And how did you only get a 10.2s on the Turbo S on a prepped surface? I've seen it do below 10s on an airfield and not driven by a pro driver."
"Oh, snap. You got two."
"Marques, your review of the Tesla Cybertruck is simply unparalleled. Your attention to detail and knack for delivering comprehensive insights make you the epitome of tech reviewing. You set the gold standard in the industry, and your dedication to excellence truly shines through in every video. Keep up the phenomenal work ‚Äì you‚Äôre the best of the best, and your expertise is unmatched. Thank you for consistently raising the bar and inspiring tech enthusiasts worldwide!"
They also say it looks sick
"Advertising for Lucid in front of a Tesla video, YouTube has understood the advertising game üòÜ"

"No, it‚Äôs not üòÇ"
"The pt was a poor car.  While the cybertruck will become common it is still exceptional.  Steer by wire, 800v and so on."
That title sequence was awesome
"23:44
The biker was  üëá because if you decide to hit him (people do hit bikers out of spite especially if there is a bikers lane), there is no physical proof on your car but the drivers were üëç because they aspire to buy the car."
"Great video and on a side note, i can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like seeing this thing on the road and not knowing about it beforehand"
"""My Child"", I like that üôÇ"
"Saw one yesterday. Glanced about 10-20 times while still focused on traffic, but kept smiling and thinking to myself ‚Äúit kinda fucks‚Äù."
This is a great video!
That intro was CLEAN
Looks stupid
"One of the most hideous designs we've ever seen for a vehicle. Cybertruck is awesome indeed, but there is something about this design that wants me to facepalm myself."
It's like the Model T. At first people were shocked and then it became a regular feeling seeing one. It will be iconic but probably 30 - 50 years from now when we are all being driven in autonomous pods.
There was an experiment of bicycle safety flags and a DD cup bra won it
Looks so awful. Tesla never made beautiful cars and I guess they never will
"Rivian and Ford are scratching their heads. The R1T and Lightning are arguably better truck than a Cybertruck, but they don't have 2 million pre-orders. I'm not even sure if they had 10,000 pre-orders. Yet this weird angular stainless steel box on wheels are taking the world by storm. And even weirder considering that a lot people are not fond of Elon Musk."
Is  it durable if it rusts very quickly?
18:50 false marketing. Typical idiotic Elon Musk.
"I thought, Most dangerous thing about Tesla Cybertruck is it's finger cutting boot."
I think a lot of hate that cyber truck / Tesla / x  gets is because of Elon's political ideology.
I really like the design! It has a cyberpunk vibe üî• It's a pity that it's not available in the EU!
"I don't see this thing being approved for public street in Europe and many asian countries with those sharp angles, huge flat surfaces and hard materials. Might be wrong, of course."
"I must say, that whole sequence leading upto the drag race and the drag race itself was the coolest and most hype part of this video!! I loved the editing and build up of that sequence. Well done guys!"
"You are not allowed to text on phone when you drive but it is obviously OK to look down,   pushing on an ipad, just to get some heat? Why does nobody talk about the danger of the touchscreen while driving?"
Why is pedestrian safety not covered in your video? Pedestrian safety is awful compared to any other car.
It is gonna be a hit in Japan üáØüáµ
yeah but in 25 years from now this car is going to be irrelevant
"@23:40 The shot with Marques sitting between the two cybertrucks. The front hood and the back trunk aligning perfectly, like some sort of symmetry. What a classy shot!"
Every time you are speaking about Tesla you should to add that Elon Musk is a russia‚Äôs nazzis puppet
I feel the beetle is very iconic car and got mass produced
"to me what's weird is that the whole body is this sharp, clean and slick futuristic body, and then the wheels are completely normal, which don't fit together (not that it's possible, wheels must be hard to make like that)"
"Bullet resistance up to 9mm isn‚Äôt much. It‚Äôs overrated to me unless it‚Äôs resistant to .308. 
Resistance to .50 would = underrated."
It will be as iconic as the Iphone.
"I doesn't matter if it's an inch or a mile, a win is a win. It doesn't matter if its the slowest Porsche 911 in the lineup, a Porsche 911 is still a Porsche 911."
No!
tesla when acouple hundred of these are ordered from middle east
15% of my diet is Cholula
"Bro the mini is iconic as well, as well as the pickup, as well as the cybertruck"
"Glad this truck isnt allowed in europe. Far to heavy, unsafe for other people involved in accident with this truck. The truck doenst have crash zones, its like a amored car, random people shouldn't drive this without extra training."
Why do I get the feeling that this video is not gonna do that well. Probably it's too late...
Lexus was first with steer by wire.
"Hmmm comparing to a PT cruiser.  Ok, let me suggest my iconic vehicle.  Volkswagen Beetle....sold around 1938 and lasted several decade.  This is my iconic comparison."
I think the difference between the cyber truck and the Chrysler is that the Chrysler had many aspects of older classic car styles but on a weird shaped body (i think it looked melted - I hate that ugly thing). Whereas the cyber truck is NEW. It doesn‚Äôt look anything like anything else at all.
I do not get it. The world has gone mad. Absolute bonkers.
Nice video
14:01 that was lit ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
"The idea is cool, but the vehicle itself is already bad, it is suppposed to be an Utility vehicle yet it has less carry space than the competitors, Japan is puting to shame the US in the PICK UP department with all it's choices, and it hurts more when you realize that the US is supposed to be Pick up Country."

I think I would powder coat mine.  Tough and less finicky than Stainless or Wraps.
Production quality so high felt like watching history tv documentary or better than that. At this stage there isn‚Äôt any one who is making this level of videos on YouTube. Keep it up MKBHD
"DUDE!! This review!!! dudeeeeeeeeee!! I'M LOVING THIS ONE TOOOO MUCH!! The music, the space where you filmed, the people on the streets... WHAT A REVIEW!!

Congrats!"
Slap on a couple zinc coated MS plates and wrap them around you with a bungee cord and you will probably get similar looks. Anyone else notice the discoloured door panel ?
"So much deceptive marketing from Tesla, they really aren't targeting people with more than 40 IQ."
"Drive-By-Wire is something I didn't know I needed but was surprised wasn't a thing sooner. I found out about fly-by-wire system because of the F-16 fighter jet quite some time ago and I just started learning how to drive recently, so I definitely hope it catches on for automobiles because that would be convenient and it's such a mainstay for aircraft for quite some time."
"Did you get those trucks on the sides when you said ""Truck Stuff""?"
People want to hate this car so bad.
"Does anyone know what player is that the shirt of, with the number 24 and the German flag?"
Dope transition man  !
Roll and pitch‚Ä¶ not roll and yaw :)
"Tesla is just like Apple. Overpriced products, but their fans are cultists so they'll praise everything their favourites will come out with.

That right there, is death in a metal box. Weird how Marq forgot to mention that."
Turns more heads than a lambo for sure
The only thing evident from this video is that MKBHD isn't a car expert :(
Iconic... Maybe in usa but not in the rest of the world. Havent seen them driving around in europe at all
Infinity did steer by wire
Fiat Multipla is also iconic üòÖ
Don't hate me but I am only here for the introüòä
Tesla Cringetruck
My mouth literally hit the floor when you entered the drag strip and slowly revealed the 911. That was so awesome. I just can't.
I hope a Studio vid is coming soon as well! The production quality was amazing!
The production on this video is insane
"In my opinion it‚Äôs just stupid, I don‚Äôt hate the design but my grime is that the radical design doesn‚Äôt solves any purpose it more than often complicates it like there is no point of it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs very bad at being a truck with that weird truckbed where you can not load things properly, it‚Äôs not very aerodynamic either‚Ä¶.nor it‚Äôs a very nimble car cuz it‚Äôs heavy and big so I mean what‚Äôs the point of the radical design it is not solving any age old truck issue neither it is doing any rocketry for electric cars‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it just looks like a stupid idea brought into mainstream because people will buy anything unique doesn‚Äôt matter how useless it is and fyi the bullet proof body is of no use the windows are normal glass so you aren‚Äôt dodging that bullet‚Ä¶.the only nice innovation is ride by wire steering that‚Äôs all"
You just know that Top gear and   Hagerty review rattled Mkbhd lol
My heart goes out to the dear that gets hit by these Tesla cyber tanks. It show will feel different than any other vehicle on the road.
We need the bulletproof car in South Africa. My friend got shot by a Taxi driver. Happens all the time here.
Nice ad.
Cool video... thanks
You definitely should have talked about the safety. Trucks this heavy should require special drivers license. They're too dangerous to be driven by regular drivers
"Nice shirt, incredible sound üòÆ greetings from Germany üòä"
"Technically this type of car should exist in 2100s. U guys in US are lucky man, to have something so obnoxious and futuristic right now!

Saying something looks like a movie prop or sci-fi is not the same thing as saying it looks good.
"Soo 10.995s is a new record for a Cybertruck, it's a car buut, not a car on a speed test.  Cooooool. I like speed.

At first watch i was gonna ask 
"" how people gonna watch you when you ride it  "" Must be new & strange experience even for you üòÇüòÇ"
It‚Äôs shite mate we all know it!
"I have been seeing them in LA more and more each day now. By the time we are used to seeing the cybertruck, the Tesla Roadster should take the spot for Tesla to keep the Iconicness."
Did you forget to drop this video in Auto focus? üòÇüòÇ
"Super interesting and reflected take. Great video, thanks MKBHD and team!!"
I wonder how fast it can go without the restrictions. 114 isn't going to cut it but still crazy.
"11:32 no effing way, 37!!! Wow!"
"after watching Adam Something‚Äôs video about this thing, It really isn‚Äôt going to work for me‚Ä¶ üíÄ"

I think I saw a Cyber trick with a dark green wrap in a video. Looks super cool and the finger print issue seems to be sortedüéâ
The hoodie trick... But I noticed the jacket! üòé
It‚Äôs like the truck version of the Delorian.
Should've got the Stig to drive in the race
Do you think the cyber truck is harder to pick up with radar?
"It's the ugliest piece of toy I ever seen. And yes, it's a toy, because a real car will never be designed to look like a joke. 
People being amazed and taking photos and videos.... I really can't get it."
"26:35 I am actually old enough to remember the launch of the PT cruiser. and I have a Clear memory of seeing the first one. My friend's mom was driving us home, and all of a sudden i hear my friend Scream ""A PT CRUISER!!!! A PT CRUISER!!!! A PT CRUISER!!!!""  I was a bit excited to see one, but it i didnt really think much of it. It was just cool that it looked somewhat like a Prowler, which was one of the coolest looking cars at the time. 
I think the hype from the Cybertruck will wear off,  but it will still be considered a cool car for a long time. I think Hypewise, it will be out generation's Hummer H2. (even knowing that our generation already got an electric H2) 
People were hyped when the OG H2 first came out, then the hype died down, as in, it wouldnt turn heads anymore, but it never really lost its cool factor."
"I would say the most dangerous thing about the car is how it responds to crashes, but hey, if you want to be tomato paste against the windshield with the minor crash ever, is up to you"
"6:21 it‚Äôs not a good thing when a car gets in a fender bender and doesn‚Äôt get damaged. I want my car to take the hit, not my body.

Marques, you are more informed about cars than me in basically every way. Do please tell me if I‚Äôm wrong here."
If this was a DIESEL I would get it in a heartbeat
Btw the Infiniti Q50 was the first mass production vehicle to use steer by wire back in like 2015
The engagement this video has is crazy.
This seems like a reply to Doug‚Äôs review
"Fantastic video! 

About the car though... Northern European here with a few questions. 

What's the stainless steel grade? I'm no steel expert but regular 304 SS won't cut it in my parts of Europe, that's for sure. It's gonna rust away in 5 minutes during the winter. And you really need to know how to work the steel during manufacturing so as not to degrade it's quality.

Also, the sturdiness concerns me. How are the crumple zones in a collision? Will it completely demolish the other car? If so, I don't think I need to worry about the steel grade, because then I don't think it will be approved for European roads anyway."
"I'm sorry, people say it's ""futuristic""? I first saw it in a n64 game, it's in the past."
"My mom always said ""big truck: small brain"".
I got a new one ""Cybertruck: no brain at all""."
Love cybertruck
"Could you make a vodeo about pedestrian safety with this truck, I really want to see how safe it is compared to other trucks by actually having these crachtest dolls."
Iconic Rust Bucket.
But is it really a truck.  I wanna take stuff w me if i buy a truck.  Just saying.
The quality control is still something else with Teslas
I rarely comment but have watched many of your videos. This is the one of your best videos and probably the best Cybertruck video on YT. üôåüèºüëäüèº
You keep saying yaw when I think you mean pitch
dude that intro was so dope
01:42 That lens flare from the front headlights makes me feel it's shot on an iPhone
"7:30 no you wont, the truck will be fine, but not the passenger"
"I think the scariest thing about the cybertruck is that if a person ever finds themself in front of one in the wrong time, they will probably endup folded on the ground. That front bumber is not pedestrian safe in any way"
37% of truck drivers tow stuff. 37. 37. Verstasium video living in my head
I did the SAME THING when i first saw one! üòÇ
"You have to understand, the only reason its not better is because of the battery pack. Once battery technology advances and becomes lighter electric cars will be the way."
Remember when seeing folding phones in wild was crazy for a while before we all accepted that as a normal mundane form factor for a phone
8:02 The sound of the door opening...üòØüòØüòØ
The cybertruck with the 114 mph top speed limit should be only on dual motor snd single motor cybertruck. The tri motor cyber beast has a top speed of 145 mph. So you have the same problem as carwow had with the pre production unit of the cyberbeast. You can get tesla to update the software for the cyberbeast. Amazing video as always
Ban ev button here üëà
"In 2024, the typical U.S. household earns about $30,000 less than is needed to afford a median-priced home and people are buying $82,000-$102,000 vehicles. /smh"

How is the sponsorship contract from Tesla going? Tesla fanboy...
And nothing was said about stains and $3000 tent... It's says a lot about Tesla engineers and media.
Intro Song - Lurking Tiger
"An overlooked aspect of the entire Cybertruck is that it might not ever be approved in Europe due to safety regulations. 

From a business perspective, this is a pretty wild strategy."
This is how auto focus should be with every car
lol they named it 'CT1' @24:37 cause they got 2 of em
Designed by kids for kids.
"Whatever YouTube is paying Marques and his fellow crew of people, it's not enough. This is a video masterpiece. Kind of like the Cybertruck itself. Bravo Marques and crew."
I love seeing Marques becoming a true Porsche owner :) Defending it like it is his honor on the line :) If I had the money I would get Porsche over Tesla any day of the week.
dude made a video and the company went bankruptü§£
"Bruh...like, the video is great...but like...maybe a touch of reverb on the voice? Its weird having Marques sounding like he's right next to my ears when in such a big space...and like some background noise..."
A bit disappointed you didn't mention the issue with structure and build regarding crumple zones. There's a reason why you don't build the outer structure of a vehicle with inflexible and hard materials.
New Jersey is soo ghetto üòÇ
Best car ever..my dream car to own
I think the Cybertruck opening the market of trucks for more people is a terrible thing. There should be less trucks not more.
"Most people rarely accelerate at max for longer than 2 seconds outbursts in daily driving their vehicle and the Cyberbeast will win that 2 seconds of acceleration against a Porsche Turbo S at a far lower cost and far more utility, that is super impressive."
Can you put it in gear with voice commands?
Doesn‚Äôt Lexus have steer by wire already
"Lexus rerleased the RZ450e last year which is also steer-by-wire. The Infiniti Q50 has steer-by-wire for years, this and the Cybertruck are the only cars that have this feature not just as an option."
"It's the modern day hummer. Everyone was excited to see one on the road at one point, and then once you saw every day, they became lame."
You didn't do the exact same drag race while towing? Lame...
Hopefully we Will never see it in Europe!
Its shapeüò¢
"Hey Marquez, would be great if you kept your hands on the steering wheel when driving, especially when in built up areas."
"9:35, ALL early production vehicles have mistakes there is NO exceptions!"
Love the lenses choice
Y'all's editing has so much style it's actually my favorite part of your channels.
Wow. Someone got a cheque to promote a garbage truck / guillotine on wheels!
It still looks like a concept
"cybertruck is a superstar 
(looks like a machine - a machine made by machines for humans )"
Waiting for a crack for the tesla for being able to use the full car :)
I would certainly be amazed too and take pictures if I saw shiny üí© on the wheels...
#1 on trending tomorrow for sure
"Ok, enough already, we get it. The Cybertruck is what a photo of six-pack abs are to Mens Health magazine, it sells but every time I see the same person talking about the same car over & over again it just smells of shelling for Musk or looking for views. Oh & no, nothing is ""Iconic"" with a year of its release, From the Hummer to the Segway, we look back at them the same way we will w/ what is without a doubt an objectively unattractive automobile, Full Stop. Lets move on now"
"Pretty cool imo, different. Iconic.



Does it come in black?"
Those tyres looks great. They look fatter than others I‚Äôve seen for some reason.
"I understand that the cyb truck is good content, however it would be usefull if people talk about its use cases, range drops with pay load and total cost of ownership compared to conventional trucks. Is the additional premeium worth it?"
"That car really is something... it is so stupid it wants to be a pickup truck but can't do anything a pickup truck would need to do. The people buying it don't need a car that big in the first place. It just seems like a car made for rich people so they are 'protected' from the poor. It is sad to see that so many people are like ""omg big car goes vroommmm"" and think that means it is a good car. The government should just band these kind of needlessly big cars, they are just for people with an ego that are to stupid to understand how shit those cars are."
"Cop: How did the accident happen??
Driver: My steering laggedüíÄüòÇ"
What an intro. Loved it
you could argue that many of apple‚Äôs products have iconic design while being mass produced also. so it could happen.
I have yet to seen a tesla plaid in my opinion this is an iconic design regadless of how many are on the rode
looks fucking sick. great review as always
The semi-trucks surrounding the cybertruck when talking about truck comparisons - that‚Äôs cinema. Great shot üëå
Damn what an intro
"Come on MKBHD, you are a tech guy üòÅYou see a door not closed, you know what is holding door once it is closed. You check the striker, adjust it, tighten and you are good. üòÄ No need to go to service center for a bolt..., unless you are not a tech guy üò±"

the video production is insane
Of course it's iconic. It's very Delorean. And fails for much the same reasons. But someone should really make a time machine out of it at some point.
"Plot twist: people behave like this cause they see Marques, not the cybertruck"
"Yea let‚Äôs make steering completely digital, because nothing could go ever wrong by doing that!"
I'm very happy these aren't allowed in the EU

"I'm telling you, this truck is going to be used for video production in more ways than one. That thing is perfect for rigging cameras, and hauling a crew on the back. It's also smooth and fast enough to keep up with sports cars."
cybertruck is epitome of looks maxing
Well done on the reviewüëèüèª When will the day come where most people won‚Äôt be wowed by a passing Cybertruck!
"Take this thing on the German Autobahn at 200 km/h+ and you'll realize the biggest problem with American cars, and Teslas in particular."
Keep the stupid car shit on autofocus idfc about this
16:11 I wonder what kind of German ultimate Frisbee shirt this is?
"I don't think ""this"" is the version of the Cybertruck what wiil be the PT Cruiser of cars, but instead a 2nd smaller footprint model (with more towing, a less aggressive slope, and better battery) that will take it to greater heights."
The car looks designed for mowing down people walking and biking
"Oh ffs, people look at it now because it's new and expensive. It will pass and only an ugly car will remain"
"The Cybertruck is simultaneously the most unique and least unique looking vehicle ever made. I own a Cybertruck, have for 5 days now, and absolutely love it. It's every bit as iconic as my first car, the VW Bug. Watching a drone video of Gigafactory Texas and looking at their parking lot that day with more than 100 Cybertrucks sitting there, I realized that uniqueness contradiction"
"""my child"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ I love this man"
there's no reason to drive such a huge truck on streets
"As an European citizen, hopefully this truck will never show on EU roads. 

It‚Äôs a safety disaster. Not for the others vehicles, but for the pedestrians and cyclists, which are everywhere in EU

I‚Äôm sure it sounds absolutely ridiculous for some people, and I really get it, but if you were living in EU, you would immediately pick up my words here

Globally, this truck is not made for EU roads, and it seems that you have to have a truck driving licence to be able to drive it (regarding the curb weight)"

You know some rich kid is going to drag race one day and take out a whole family
The steer by wire is done for the purposes to control your car in the future. Like government or Tesla. You said ‚ÄúTesla didn‚Äôt have to do this‚Äù ü§î
"Something we're not talking about: Is going that fast in a 7,000 lb truck not a bit dangerous. I mean, yes fun, but also kinda scary, even with all the safety features Teslas have? Food for thought."
Initially i didn't like the design when it was revealed.  But now i absolutely love the cybertruck.
That Intro was fire ü§Ø
I kinda ugly as well as beautiful üòÖ
The difference is that the PT cruiser is a actual shit car in nearly every way.
iconic failure.
I'm still waiting on my Foundation series delivery. The unobtanium comment is true.
Congrats on making it to the National Team!
0:26 So it's dangerous because everyone around you is too busy making fun of your Tesla Clusterfuck to pay attention to the road?
"I know the interior of tesla's is iconic and futuristic.. but oh god, do a version of cyber truck with interior with 70s/80s style big fat cream colored switches and buttons with led lights..bonus if you can do a overhead panel switches to start the truck.."
"COPIUM, copium is the word you are looking for m8, the car is a literal wedge. This thing is ugly as sin."
"I mean, it's something yes."
"Oh, it's iconic, alright! The ugliest and most useless vehicle ever made."
"Did I miss it or does truck stuff not have any mention about being able to pick up stuff and put it in the back of your pickup? Towing you say is not popular, but what about hauling?"
Talking about performance and not mentioning the range..... witch is disappointing
i think this turck is gonna flop... flop hard.  maybe it sold during the first set but i predict no one will buy those in a second go.
The problem is buying a hangar to park it
That reveal of the track and the porshe was so perfect I cant
"The Silverado EV has more range, also have 4 wheel steering, much better frunk, it opens the back of the cab to allow things up to 10ft to fit.
Overall it just seems to be a much better truck. Although I think the stainless steel is actually a better material for endurance, if you wrap it up in the first day to avoid rusting."
Loved this review!
@engineering_explained he got the whiteboard!
"It is very bad at crash test, because of it, the car is not safe."
17:09 my child :') I get it. All car guys get it. My E46 is my baby too.
can you add a car rap to it
Only car guys hate this car. They dont like electric cars. They sxare of changes.
This is the kinda attention I get now by cycling in India!
Imagine hitting a child with that truck. Wouldn't you prefer to drive a car that allows children to survive such scenario?
"I can confirm what you said about the PT cruiser. I bought one in 2002, when I was only 23, and it got a LOT of attention. But 99% of that attention was from people in their 50s-60s. ü§£

I really liked the car though and actually bought a GT in 2005. But then in 2008 I came to my senses and replaced it with a BMW 135i."
DBrand skin will fix the problem of fingerprintüòÇ. Imagine that.
nice
"That was very good. Well done, well spoken, well researched!

It‚Äôs just unreal for me to buy this expensive car. Maybe a video about the best beginners EVs would be nice."
this is some vdo production!
"Jeez, barely any mention of actually using the CT for truck stuff."
"People on the street ""look at this goofy vehicle, someone bought one"" 
I live in Central Alberta, this is the most impractical ""truck"" ive ever seen lmao"
You missed one thing why people by a truck. Height. It taller than a lot of other cars & SUV on the road. It easier to see while driving.
Elon groupie
This is not the first car to ship with steer by wire
Tesla Cybertruck is very eye catching Car and Marques has made an Iconic Video
Aloha from Hawaii! i love your show. We have a Tesla dealership on Oahu Island. I see at least 10 Tesla's a day. But no Cybertruck yet!
"Cybertruck is not bulletproof. Just do a search on YouTube and you will see.
I would rather get a BYD U8."
it's true. everytime I see one I give the same reaction.
"There's one other, most important, point you're not addressing comparing it to a race car like the 911. A race car like this is made to be fast when NOT driving in a straight line, but on a proper race track, being fast on corner after corner ... Racecars, like a 911, are made for N√ºrbuegring kind of 'roads' rather then 'simple' drag race strips.

Just saying ;)

The Roadster would be the better Tesla to compare to a 911, and on its own (proper) 'natural habitat' ;)"
"Iconic? history determines that, Ferrari F40, Ford GT40, F1 McLaren, Porsche 911, Mustang, Countach, DB5 Aston, Veyron, Gulwing Merc, Jaguar XJ ... etc .... How anyone can say this truck is iconic is beyond me. Its new, its cool, its novelty but ICONIC? C'mon man!"
100k is still to much for a work truck if he want to beat f150.
You should do more car reviews
From scipt to detailed feature talk...movie like experience this video really. When are we getting the feature film directorial debut from Marques???
"Elon was other day railing on Boeing after their Door came off and how DEI is responsible for Boeing defects etc, now some of your own vehicles were sent out without proper torqueing of Cybertruck doors, what DEI practices do you employ Elon that resulted in such a glaring mistake?"
911 turbo s is one of the fastest launching cars ever made? complete bollocks.
Ahh the official apple and tesla glazer goes again
"Living in Vegas, naturally I've seen a couple of these already. And they were both wrapped!"
MKBHD intros man ü•µ
Why you wearing Deutschland shirt?
I was kinda beginning to like Tesla until I discovered Elon Musk gives unwaivering support to racists and pseudoscience surrounding race such as IQ level on twitter.
Might be one of Marques' best videos to date.  So damn well done.
Y'all using the wrong helmets for the drag race.  You got on motorcycles helmets which differs from auto race helmets.  Mainly the fire protection that the auto race helmets has that the moto helmet does not.
11:33 magical number from Veritasium's video! 37% of truck drivers tow!
Steer-by-wire without the use of a steering column was first offered in a production car with the Nissan Infiniti Q50 in 2013.
This is the most wholesome Cybertruck review. Great stuff.
Can‚Äôt wait to get one
Marques is slowly turning into Doug but for electric cars reviews
"They need to make a compact version soon, with all the new innovative tech that's inside."
"It's not the pointy edges......its the way it has made youtubers behave, reviewing it every week"
It' not iconic it's gross you guys just like it (i didn't watch the video)
"I'd say the Porsche 911 is an iconic design I'd have on my bedroom wall, but I do see it everywhere."
10.9s 1/4 mile is less than 11 as they advertised! Obviously not a race car but dang. Impressive.
"It's a truck for tech bros. Good for them, they need a rivian alternative. Overall, its more cringe than cool."
It‚Äôs shit like this why no one takes MKBHD seriously as a car journalist.
These videos
"Toyota bz4 has steer by wire as an option, but seems nobody knows. Bz4 went under the radar because its not up to par with the competition. ""Engineering explained"" has a video on it."
Wow! What a great review. Thank you Marques.
BEAUTIFUL INTRO
"Putting aide how it looks, the thing is terrible no matter how you look at it. Even if the driver does not give a damn about the safety of others (which the customer base will not):
- it started rusting already for many people
- the edges are so sharp they can cut
- the car vibrates when closing the doors 
- the milage is a lie 
- is not bulletproof"
I have the Mercedes EQS suv and when I tell you that it brings sooooo much attention believe me when I tell you it‚Äôs a nightmare
Wish it was in my price range but I‚Äôm waiting for my highland
from what i hear from people who live in LA. People don‚Äôt really look twice at the cybertruck anymore üòÖ
It's not same car my youth lol
"Already? I'd argue it was iconic from the first day it was revealed, even if it had never been publicly released."
No disgusting.
Musk knows how to profit from the new world of IDIOCRACY. Invest in stupid and you will never be poor again.:)
The amount of time you spend on the review units and the coherence with which you stitch the review considerations over a long period is what makes your videos tick.
V8 V8 V8 !!!
I'm bit surprised the review doesn't mention that rear view camera which is needed oh the tonaue cover is closed doesn't have a cleaner but the front camera does have a cleaner. But I think it's something worth mentioning. Not a huge knock but an odd choice.
What happens when you have a faulty sensor and the steering can't connect with the wheels while driving?
That intro animation üòÆ‚Äçüí®
lexus rz have had steer by wire from 2021
"Useless review, junk truck, and I use the term truck loosely"
Y3K
"was too good of a review to not release on autofocus, MKHD low key became the #1 car reviewer on youtube."
Who the hell uses two hands while parking or turning and is worrying about hand over hand thing? Have they ever seen how people drive?
I don't think that looking like a movie prop is a compliment üòÇ
Great production.  üëç
damnn intro is üî•üî•üî•
This car is just ugly and no way I would by car like this.
Man that transition was smooth
"Finally some car guy content in the main channel! (Could've been a auto focus video, but higher content quality for main channel?)"
Very Casey Neistat futuristic vibe if you know what I mean‚Ä¶ love it
"The reason why some people don't like it is because of jealousy. Because anyone can come up and draw the design of it and yet when some company is rich and recognizable enough to do it - it automatically makes it ""iconic,"" and ""original"""
"That intro sequence was üî•üî•üî• it's comparable to hearing 808s drop or an unexpected beat transition.... I had to run that back a few times ! ü´° ... This has to be the best overall review of the Cyber truck, hands down. Thanks for giving us top tier quality every time."
This is the best MKBHD video ever made. HANDS DOWN
"I suspect the biker wasn't happy being blinded by the headlights, as that apparently is a thing with the Cybertruck"
"Well done and very balanced video with all the critics, but I must say travelling with the cybertruck and any other truck with this power is a different world it is almost diving a luxury sedan in a truck size."
"Gotta love the MKBHD double hoodie look, never change Marques"
Seems to me Tesla went way above and beyond in terms of the details of the Cybertruck. Not sure I‚Äôd ever want one but it‚Äôs pretty damn well designed.
"A refrigerator on wheels, I knew it was familiar.  I really should come with an ice cube maker."
We all know trucks are a thing because of the tax system
How is that like a PT Crusier? ü§£
Thats a Sick introüî•üî•üî•
Loving that production quality Marques!
"OMG! Love that German Frisbee Association jersey on you! And by the way, YOU are already iconic!"
10:04 DOP silently pulled most iconic shot of this video üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Those are NOT all terrain tires. Maybe All SEASON but not all terrain.
intro goes hard
"i hate this damn car so much, the biggest ugliest 4 wheel death machine lol. if you get into an accident at high speeds, the person on the other end is COOKED"
"You forgot to talk about the rust problems, how the visibility is bad, how the car is not bulletproof and false advertising. This thing shouldn't be on the road."
Marques has now gone full on Jeremy Clarkson üòÇ
I live in the Bay Area in a pretty well off area and I‚Äôve already seen 4 of these things. First one was exciting and the most recent one I saw was just in my way when I was trying to get on the freeway. I think the cybertrucks iconicness wont vanish but will definitely be watered down over time.
I have a stainless steel trashcan with black plastic bottom. This looks like its bigger brother.
This is a textbook review for all the self-proclaimed reviewers.
Marques can make a long video but feel so short. Was shocked to see it‚Äôs ending 26:29
This felt like a new-generation Top Gear car review... loved it!
"You're the best at these videos for a reason. Love the end point on the possible iconic arc of the Cyber Truck as more and more are out roaming the streets.  And let's not forget, Michael Scott in The Office drove a PT Cruiser. üòÇ"
Crazy
XIAOMI CAR
I can solve your question for you‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an ugly door wedge
It's not about the truck itself it's about steer by wire and the 48-volt architecture. These are the future.
I'll behave the way they behaved.
Another very well considered video. I love how you appraise tech on many levels and from different perspectives. üëèüëè
"12:39 Bro tweeted ‚Äúhelp cybertruck crashed. @elonmusk can you help me get another‚Äù

??? wtf is wrong with people. No shame at all"
Another banger from the tech goat ü´∂
Dudeeee the intro wtffff üòç
The most dangerous thing about it is the finger chopping automatic frunk..
It‚Äôs pretty sick right now. In time we all get used to how it looks. I saw my first one in Seattle and there was a crowd around it haha
"Feels like watching same video twice , only because of auto focus üåù"
they f*cked up the roof.with a flat roof it wouldn't look bad. the pointy hat is the part that doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. there are reasons why a car or truck roof is not designed like the roof of a house
This is the Future!
"Thank you for a well reasoned, objective and evidence based review that evokes confidence, joy and awesomeness via a highly quality video production.  üòäüòä‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
The PT cruiser was never cool!!
You‚Äôre comparing a truck to a Porsche and then saying the performance is overrated?  Maybe you should rethink your reasoning on that one. Also the utility is overrated? I can‚Äôt remember you mentioning how it failed you in any of its truck duties. If you aren‚Äôt using it as a truck maybe you shouldn‚Äôt buy one but its utility can only reasonably be judged by its functional capabilities.
That intro animation is slick!!!
"Nah
It‚Äôs just you. 
They were filming you üòÖ"
"People have never heard of CyberTruck   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

LOL  People have never heard of T E S L A  !!!!!!!!!!"
simply one of the best-produced youtube videos I've ever seen
you are a fake tech reviewer
"13:24 Not gonna lie, MKBHD with the hoodie deployed aint the fit."
"when you say ""the aerodynamics of a fridge"" that's a CoD of 0.34 which is better than a Bugatti Chiron and the average SUV"
T R I A N G L E    T R U C K  !  !  !  !  !  !      its a religion !
This is channel is slowly turning into a show-off shitshow of whatever he is able to get his hands on. Not many quality electronic product reviews as he used to make.
"it was against the law for them to do the rear view mirror as a screen, which is why they stuck a dinky mirror in there."
Tesla is not the first to do Steer-by-wire. I think it was Lexus. Also i think you reviewed that car lmao???
in the future hope to see this car
Can the Tesla cyber truck take white pictures of black people?ü§î
Faster then a Corvette ‚ù§
10:06 love how you switch to Truck Stuff while just casually rolling between 2 huge trucks :)
22:07That is the most logical explanation üëç.
"Dude,, your content quality and attention to detail is absolutely ridiculously amazing."
Where is the license plate?
"Tesla should also look at mixing their Steel with conventional metals for their next iteration of the CT. You really don't need a pure stainless steel vehicle actually. It's cool n all, but really not needed for city use."
i love the intro
"it has an 800v architecture just hasn't taken effect due to lack of infrastructure, so why are we talking about kwh charging speed?"
I want to know what happens if the steering ‚Äúvideo game‚Äù module/fuse malfunction or breaks while driving? Any type of warning or would it be chaos?üòÖ
Plz review xiaomi su 7
I want to see you do a review of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. It also uses 800 volt architecture üòÆ
watching this video for free feels illegalüòÖüòÇ
"Wow, comparing the Cybertruck to the PT Cruiser. Time will tell, but this was one Detroit friendly review"
I like it!
Its giving Diamonhead vibes from Ben10
6:40 Thought he was grabbing the blicky üòÜ
Cyber beast is the gayest thing ive ever heard
An 8 or 9 passenger Cyber SUV would be awesome.
Biggest disappointment is the Prototype had seating for 6 the production model is limited to 5 and has a huge console in the center.
Cybertruck is an exotic car. for common masses it will never be a car of choice
Better video production than the car Channel MKBHD made specifically to review cars
"Despite all the things I saw about the Cybertruck, I still can't understand why someone would actually buy the thing if not to show off on the road. It has less capacity than a mini van, more expensive, less durable, heavier, wider, less secure and has massive problem with maintenance on top of a lot of having manufacturing problems...
Like, if this is the car of the future, I just wish to live in the past them..."
"First 1 minutes of this video, that's exactly what I did every time I saw the Cybertruck"
This is üíØ Iconic. I think is looks amazing.
Incel Camino.
I‚Äôm not an expert but steer by wire reminds me of how our body is controlled by our nervous system so in a philosophical way it actually makes a lot of sense and seems like the way forward.
"""my child"""
"Something can be mass produced and still be iconic. The Cybertruck is certainly different. ""Iconic"" feels like a word that can only be earned over time though. It's on the right track."
That intro was sick üî•üôåüèæ
"What blows me away about Cybertruck's steer by wire system isn't that it's a thing now... it's that the previous Tesla models with yokes DIDN'T have it.

I thought that was the ENTIRE POINT of the yoke! It's a different shape because you don't need to go hand over hand making multiple full circles to steer. But you're telling me this is the FIRST Tesla to have steer by wire?"
Are you planning on painting your cyber truck flat black?
Still never buying an EV.
"It totally looks like a sci-fi movie prop to me. The people that wrapped theirs I think fixed the fingerprint problem hopefully and it honestly looks sick wrapped. I never thought it looked dumb, I always thought it looked like a car for Mars. I like that it exists to excite me about the creativity of the automobile industry. Let's get some new shapes and fun personalities to the cars. Why not?"
"The biggest problem imo with this is the boring ass interior. it‚Äôs such a stark contrast from the wild retro futuristic exterior. It would have been so cool had it been more cockpity control panely (think delorean, or really any car from the 80s with a cockpit style interior. not to mention how much more practical it would be. we want buttons, switches, dials and what not. Thats cyberpunk. thats the whole aesthetic. not this minimalist no button bs."
"Honestly trucks like this should be banned from school areas. Such a hazard to pedestrians! I do appreciate that drive by wire though, looks like a step in the right direction.."
Carbon Fiber wheels and Track Tires might get a faster time in the Cyber truck
I just wanna say I see trucks getting stuck in the snow more than some good ol‚Äô AWD Subarus.
"Iconic doesn't mean rare. The design of a Jeep is iconic, but they're a dime a dozen. Certain iPhone models can be described as iconic, but also mass market. All iconic means is that it is a thing that defines a certain idea to a large group."
holy shit. Everything about this video is üî•üî•üî•üî•
Yeah it's iconically ugly. But not as iconically ugly as EV depreciation. You serve the global elite. 2035 everybody electric. If you say something counter government. remote start stop. No more driving for u.
I still think it's ugly even driving next to them but in my opinion I think the wheels are the only good looking thing on it from the outside
this has nothing to do with the cybertruck (though I love the vid and all your vids)...but what brand of hoodie are you wearing?? love it!
Maybe we review again after 1 year not weakly
Love how it looks tbh
it looks cool and probably will not rust but there are to many buts. but in 10 yrs electrical vehicles might be a good option. so thank you early adopters/beta testers
"Man, The whole team decided to step up with this One !!!
Right from that awesome intro till the end the production was top-notch. Amazing job guys.üëèüëèüëè"
Oh crap!!! I for one am old enough to remember when the pt cruiser came out and I remember how folks talked about it. I remember folks stopping folks who had one. It was an odd shaped lil whip. Years later I bought one. I wish I hadn‚Äôt tho lololol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You know what‚Äôs iconic? This reviewüòá
how did you record video that smooth in a crowded streets
"Well, there's nothing like the cybertruck on the road... üíØ"
"duct tape on a factory manufactured car ‚Äî this is how you become paid (with a twist) tester for elon, god bless tesla buyers, be safe  in your gigantic steel boxes."
It‚Äôs just like the first Macintosh changed everything
"14:20 911 is just too boring, too normal, it doesnt even matter if its faster, both cars are fast."
0:18 How is that dangerous? ü§£
"Finally I saw it on the road, my opinion, it doesn‚Äôt look that good from outside, I don‚Äôt know inside, it‚Äôs new shape of pickup makes people look at it but by the time it will be not that elegant"
Great videos man you make nothing but abgers
It looks good
"Elon can identify the specific number of trucks that had a loose bolt, but couldn't/didn't fix it at the factory? Oh wait, no he only identified the 15 after they left, ah yes."
Hey I know you hate the mirror but rear view mirrors are good for parents etc to see the back seat- this is why trucks and vans have them despite not being able to see out the back window. If this was replaced with a screen it would be weird or cameras would have to look into the backseat. I think its fine having behind your car like a reversing camera on the main screen.
"I definitely think there is a really good chance that once they are common and people see them everywhere, any allure from the rarity will be gone and people will think they are annoying lol"
How did marquess change from wearing a sweater inside the truck to a jacket going outside the truck
"When there are many of these 7000lb moving bulletproof, blinding, razorblades on the road, I don't see how you can possibly say that *that* isn't the most dangerous thing about the truck. Sports cars that can move that fast can also stop very fast. Stopping 7,000 lbs quickly is just not happening. I've seen the braking tests. So yeah, this is the family guy episode... ""Good luck everyone else!"""
this is a perfect design for a pedestrians destroyer.
They forgot the anti aliasing on this one.
A moment of a appreciation for the quality of this video
"""My Child"""
"the only thing about this guy that bugs me is how he simps for Musk and Tesla. This 'truck' rusts out and preforms poorly in any kind of normal weather exposure. I would like him to try and use an electric vehicle in REAL weather, like Alaska. See how he likes them then."
Iconic to id10ts. Just like iPhones.
The intro was dope!
"I love how some people who dont have to buy this truck hate on it soo much. The ones who love the fact this happened are the one who will buy it, thats all that matters. Great review, lovers and haters."
"Clients shouldn't be beta testers for automobile producers, that's what development is for."
"So MKBHD, you compared the 911 Turbo S with a naked base price  of 230.400 üòÇüòÇüòÇ . That‚Äôs TWO Foundation Series Cyberbeasts"
"20:30 Yeah it may look like a fridge, but if ya did your research, the cybertruck is tremendously aerodynamic & efficient, 0.335 drag coefficient is pretty impressive for any vehicle this size. 

Disappointed you glossed over that."
"Best video ever. Soundtrack, editing, MKBHD, everything."
"I remember the first PT Cruiser I saw. I hadn't heard anything about it before, but along Miami Beach on a Saturday night in early summer one came down the street past all the bars, sound system thumping with windows down, two stylishly dressed young men inside. Everybody turned to look. Everybody.
That's the CT today. I was tired of the design before the first one sold, but people seeing it for the first time are sure to turn and look."
That drag race drone shot is insane!
damnn the intro pull off though üî•üî•üî•
Not at all surprised that 63% of 1/2 ton truck owners don't tow with them. You don't (shouldn't) buy an F150 or a Silverado 1500 for towing anything decent sized. You buy a 250/2500 or 350/3500.
Honestly at this point I just want some cars to be aesthetically distinct enough to define the decade. It‚Äôs boring if we all follow the same formula. Cars in the 50s and 60s were more diverse than they are now. It sucks
Love the visuals
"drag race was next level marques 
üòÑ"
Just going back to the well? Like...
Elon will upgrade the motors to the Cybertruck with some Plaids and then the results will change???
Once these become police cars... it will be more hated. Im still getting one.
i've already seen 5 cybertrucks while driving rideshare in vegas lol
"I love how top creators almost universally find creative ways to praise this car and never openly talk about its flaws:
- small storage capacity
- can‚Äôt tow
- chops off your fingers
- it freaking RUSTS. Or it‚Äôs not actually rust, who cares?, 100k car can‚Äôt handle the rain, come on"
Toyoytas did the ride by wire early and im talking about lexus!
2000 miles on a car in a month is crazy
"Steer by Wire was there in the Nissan Infinity Q50 around 2013. Though, from I know, it wasn't a big hit. They still have some of it in the Nissan QX 50 and 55 in 2022."
I saw one of these Bugatti Veyron‚Ä¶ in Newport coast about 12 years ago‚Ä¶ never saw it again
Blackberry owners also insisted on the value of physical buttons...  disruption takes a period of adjustment... automobiles are no exception.
It looks like a geek
That flex to bring your own 911üòÇüòÇ
"It's still an ugly piece of kit, a heavy mastodon which is totally unadapted to roads and cities in Europe and many other places on earth."
"Why not? Iconic doesn not mean perfect or even good, this car will definitely be remembered."
"First time watching an MKBHD video that feels sponsored. Idk, maybe I'm just seeing my own things."
"I honestly love the look. It's the definition of iconic, goofiness and all. So fucking tired of how lazy and boring car design has been for the last 20 years."
i want a truck just because i can go to a home center and buy a couch and not pay for the delivery.  or a long wood.
I say lower the Cybertruck and flare front and rear fender then install some sick wider tires.  Put a adjustable wing in the tail then it will look like a sick sports car not a truck
Brilliant honest review dude. Nice one! And that Tron start animation was a treat.
The most dangerous thing is the drivers.  Tesla drivers are the worst.
This is a review.
"A truck - is a motor vehicle designed to transport freight, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. this is none of those. no need to go any further"
Elon is not making cars for earth .
üòÇ 14:37 This moved from a review to a drag race
Just subtly pulls around the 2nd cybertruck..... üòÖ
"Pretty sure Lexus launched steer by wire too, not sure if they were first or Tesla. But definitely underrated feature and must be implemented in every car in the next decade."
This video is weird af
Just seeing the number of videos ive seen with a cybertruck in it has made it a normal car for me so yes it will peak and age about the same as a PT Cruiser [27:12]
From which phone is the footage from 13:42 shot by? it looks very bad compared to the previous part and has a lot of focusing errors.
why didnt you talk about the rusting
"Years ago I was in Indianapolis and they sent a limo to pick me up from the airport to take me to my hotel. And honestly... there were a lot of people losing their minds seeing a guy in a limo. But yeah, I imagine the Cybertruck gets a ton of attention."
I love it. The engineering is incredible and I think it looks sharp. I hope more companies take risks and create like this.
This icon specifically üóëÔ∏è
Imagine the drag times with slicks on that car üòÇ
Thank you for the great conclusion. Great video!
good to see you driving the car in this review :)
The Ford Pinto is iconic too. Doesn't mean you want to own one of course.
"Count me among those who think it looks cool. I had lunch the other day with a woman who was just flipping out with desire to buy one. She's a Tesla driver already but she hadn't seen your review about it and was so excited when I shared that with her. I suspect that before the year is out, she'll be telling me about her new Cybertruck."
most killer intro of all times üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
11:30 63% never tow that means 37% people actually tow with their trucks. 37% ! ! ! Veritasium would like to have a word with you sir.
"Elon Musk is a bigot who wants a ‚Äúmassive red wave‚Äù in November. If you support the Cybertruck, you are supporting that movement. 

I can‚Äôt separate it. Maybe those are your personal views, too. 

I‚Äôve lost all respect for you and @jerryrigeverything"
I'm getting EE vibes with the numbers on the whiteboard. This is a good thing!!
"Yep, best video ever"
what is rat cut the 'steer by wire' wire.
Can‚Äôt stand all the cheap black plastic on cars these days
10:06 I don‚Äôt know if anyone noticed this cool Easter üê£‚Ä¶ two trucks and cyber truck leading as the apex predator
It's like iron man head
"The most dangerous thing about these is there‚Äôs no crumple zone if you wreck, which causes all the shock to go to your body and cause even more damage than crashing in a normal car would do. Cars are meant to crumple when crashed to help absorb that shock"
I think Rivian is the ugliest truck
"High-VIN cars aren't immune from their own problems, either. My mother's '23 Toyota Corolla shipped *_without external weatherproofing seals._* Her dealer was absolutely confused from start-to-finish but eventually, we got the seals for the doors and trunk installed and _oh would you look at that_ the trunk now opens as-expected rather than subtly moving a couple of centimetres. Car must've been made on a Sunday, with that mishap."
sorry buy this video is on another level!
6:45 I really fucking thought he was about to pull out a gun
"From a tech standpoint, it‚Äôs cool. From a car guy stand point, EVs will make car culture extinct"
"It'll wear off. Just like how it's kind of boring to watch another falcon 9 first stage landing, even though its a technological marvel."
cant be a truck if you cant tow farther than 100 miles a ‚Äútank‚Äù imo. will be cool when theyre worth $30k
"When the airpod pro came out, we all said worse, next thing it the most solt earphone in history. This means this truck will sell alot. Looking at ur car does not maje it dangerous. If are close to Musk you could have made him who than tweeting"
"So, how about the rust?"
"I think you should've have mentioned the Delorean, Iconic S/Steal and black plastics too!"
Wasn't it McLaren that did it first? Electronic steering. I think there is a video on engineering explained youtube channel
Trash vehicle
"There are numerous ""iconic"" popular cars: Volkswagen Typ 1 ‚ÄúBeetle,‚Äù VW Typ 2 ‚ÄúBus,‚Äù Citro√´n 2CV, Citro√´n DS, Citro√´n Traction Avant, Ford Model T, Ford Sierra, BMC Austin/Morris Mini, Austin Seven, Fiat 500 ‚ÄúTopolino,‚Äù Fiat ‚ÄúNuova‚Äù 500, Fiat Panda, Fiat Multipla, Renault Twingo, Renault Espace, Land Rover ‚ÄúDefender,‚Äù Jeep CJ, etc."
"Just started the video, but had to comment what an intro!!!"
Damn that intro !
That intro graphics is sick!
"I think this is your highest production quality video ever! 

Your videos don't need it to be engaging - but those motion and info graphics, the writing and pacing, the race skit? Phenomenal job to all of you. 

Also, HOW DID YOU GET THE AUDIO SO CLEAN IN A MASSIVE, SEEMINGLY EMPTY WAREHOUSE?! Massive kudos.

I've been watching you since you were comparing beats studios to ATH-m50s, and I'd probably still watch you if you reviewing TV remotes."
you can‚Äôt fit jack in the cyber‚Äôtruck‚Äô üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ
of course a simp review.
Dangerous car
"Wasn't this video originally called something like ""I'm living with the cybertruck so you don't have to""?  Elon must have reached out hard.."
It looks like a early videogame vehicle prop
"Towing isn't the same as just having a truck for utility.. Projects around the house, getting rid of junk, picking up stuff from Lowes, etc.. None of those are ""Towing"", but most people that drive a truck have used it for ""utility"" that a car is not capable of."
"BRAVO!!
Very well done."
Imagine having a lot of stickers on the front would be great
It‚Äôs just a Delorean
"First of all, how much is Elon paying you to say all of this? üòÖ"
Cyber truck has a feature called ‚Äú Reality distortion field ‚Äú
i honestly thing if it didn‚Äôt have the huge back it would be a good looking car because i actually love the front view look ‚Ä¶the back is actually mortifying tho
"You are really good. Thanks for your reviews. I played ultimate to a pretty high level - so for you to be a ""pro"" and (i'm guessing you aren't playing much since you became a youtube star) - and be a great reviewer of tech generally is fantastic."
Great review MKBHD üëè
"Probably one of the ugliest cars I‚Äôve ever seen, wouldn‚Äôt even want it for free"
We need more videos of you on the track! This one was definitely special though..
Cruising thru Harrison in a cyber truck is crazy lol
That car is ugly.
"The only car nobody cares about LOL

(except for creators)"
what an intro üëå
My main issue is the range. I really thought Tesla would knock it out of the park. Idc about the towing as much but I was hoping since it‚Äôs a new gen vehicle they‚Äôd try to blow Chevy and the rest of the field out of the water. It didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs extraordinarily durable which is cool but the positives kind of end there for me
He‚Äôs wrong when saying you‚Äôll be fine because the car is built with metal. There‚Äôs a reason cars have crumple zones and are made of weaker material and it‚Äôs for crash ratings. A crash could cause severe injuries for the passengers. Also this car wasn‚Äôt crash tested but is being sold. Cause usa regulations are a joke
"Does it come in black.

  - bruce Wayne -"
25:36 nice headlights
"63% of truck owners admit to never towing anything?
Or is it 37% of truck owners claim to have towed something?
37!"
""" if someone hits you"" . . . there's a reason cars crumble"
That race was totally UNEXPECTED...
The concept of EV And you have to wait in fast charger station for more than an hour to charge is absolutely ridiculous and time waste. Never get EV get hybrid!
This thing is an embarrassment to the auto industry
"Gotta hand it to Tesla, the truck uses less polys so its easier on the simulation we live in."
Gotta give it to Elon for marketing a piece of shit into a success.
This video puts watching tech videos I can't afford to a whole new level ü§£
thanks
This was a really fair review. Nice
"So that‚Äôs why he got the Porsche, so he could test it out against the cyber truck"
Iconic
I'm amazed that he could strike it with a hammer without damaging it!
"Zac tested many rounds of different caliber bullets into the back door on his channel. Interesting what the end results were. But this vehicle will never be of interest to me in it's present shape. Put the tech it has, into another better looking vehicle, then you'll get a better customer base"
Cons of having a steer by wire. Imagine your battery ran out in the middle of the road. How the hell are you supposed to push your car to the side of the road. If you cant steer coz the battery is dead
what shirt is he wearing ?
It's interesting to see a car company actually trying interesting things. If I was rich enough I'd get one
11:35 37% of people tow. Maybe Veritasium was right‚Ä¶
Tesla needs to fix the Cybertruck front lights; point it a bit lower yes but also make it brighter and/or cover a wider angle. Based on what I've personally seen in videos on the Internet.
I reckon people shouldn't give money to a company run by a nazi.
I want to work for you. Been my dream since 2017
Cool! Thanks for sharing it. ‚úåÔ∏è
People stare because somebody was actually stupid enough to buy something that ugly
What you needs is a rocket launcher like the ones you see on missile cruiser.  Open the cover and raise the missile for all to see also put a machine gun that is fully articulating.  While you are at it bring up the laser gun.  use the power built in the truck to fire the laser.  Now you will lose the looks the drivers around you will be scared like hell
Bro that intro was wild üòÅ
That‚Äôs probably the best intro you‚Äôve ever done. That was dope
"American car culture seems to have embraced the ute (pickup truck) NOT out of necessity, but out of image. Unfortunately, the 'Yank Tanks' are making their way here as well, clogging street-side parking bays and endangering everyone on the road. The average person does not need this much vehicle, let alone its ludicrous speed and horsepower that evoke a pretentiousness only capable in an exceptionalist society like the USA. The Cybertruck is the definition of excess, pitched to people with a gaping void of purposelessness. ""Maybe if I was bigger/stronger/faster then I'd be happier"". Look at them go, blindfolded blackout drunk, an unregulated autopilot steering a 7 tonne unstoppable stainless steel force: their preferred mask presenting themselves to the outside world like a badge of success. If this is not so, this vehicle would not exist because as explained in this video, more functional utes exist and have existed for years and cost less. American aggrandisement: make what you want, not what they need. Better the world one billionaire at a time and wonder why you're still in pain. The Cybertruck's purpose will not fulfil yours, believe me."
"Looks fucking awesome, looks like tank, just like in architecture there is Brutalist architecture, this is Brutalist design which has own simplicity own beauty, show the material and shape"
To rich dads out there. Plz do not give this to your teenage son. He will maim someone.
"Even marques who thinks he needs a pick up truck for his work actually doesn't need it,  he will be better off with a van for his production stuff"
The fact that MKHB can influence how technology is moving forward is insane
The most dangerous thing is the fucking child arm dismembering front trunk
Low poly renders
Cyber truck is the Fortnite cars on the Nintendo switch
Haha a death machine
"Marques, you never told us how much it is."
"Let me let you know: it looks like sh*t. Hope that helps. 

Also, millions of Cybertrucks on the road? LOL"
I drive a f150 raptor and I have never tow anything in my life üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It's already rusting
Saw one yesterday on my daily walk. I had to put it on my IG story! üòÇ
"You gotta compare it to the Escalade. Sure you can buy it and it's mass produced, but no one's giving celebrities shit for riding in the backseat of one. 27:24"
The birds eye view drag race shot was super cool. First time I think I've ever seen something like that in a car review.
"Naaaaahhhh, Marques went too hard on this video! Darn, it's good good üòÆ.....

Although I sum up the review as ""CT didn't need to exist, but we're glad it does, kinda"""
The only people hating the cybertruck are the lefties for their political agenda.
"‚Ä¶ when buying a truck, fingerprint were never on my list of concerns."
"Iconic - No
Moronic - Yes üòä
Great video as always btw!"
‚ÄúAt the moment Cybertruck is super rare‚Äù - not in San Diego: I saw 5 of them today üòÇ. They‚Äôre as popular as I‚Äôd expected‚Ä¶ and dreaded.
"Im telling you bro, switch out those tires for some flat racing tires itll change the look of the whole truck especially when it‚Äôs lowered"
If someone guessed 200-300k i bet they have an old honda 1992 and the ac is broken or probably elon picked them up on his way back from mars with some of these rockets they keep blowing up on the way up there....
Fun fact: they are actually staring at and filming Marques
I saw it. It‚Äôs fxx ugly üòÇ
"Yes, I know that the Cybertruck is an eye magnet.  I would use it to attract females   Answer to my problems."
No mention of the Deloran at the end? Definitely one of the coolest cars to see on the road to this day and it‚Äôs ‚Äúrare‚Äù
my truck will be fully rigged with removable components for long distance commute and pleasure.
"I experienced the same thing in the Mini Cooper. When the first of the new generation Coopers first started hitting the US, my family got to drive one for a week (very early on) as the company my father worked for was involved with some marketing work for them. I remember us trying to leave his parking garage, and the attendant getting out of his booth, circling the car and asking questions about it lol."
Thanks!
No.
"Pushing super hard to convince the world that this vehicle is a thing‚Ä¶guess what, the rest of the world is laughing at you Americans for getting yourselves a cyber truck - get yourself a Porsche bro or at least something German üá©üá™"
Saw 2 of them in my town today and it is pretty badass in real life‚Ä¶everyone around me pulled their phones out
It‚Äôs the Volkswagen Beetle of our generation
"i would argue that this is the best, crispiest piece of content ever put out by team MKBHD. incredible."
Booooooooo
Thought Matt Watson was gonna pop out for a second after Marquess sat in his Porsche race üòÇ
If i get this thing its gonna have to be polished chrome. hell yea
"so far ive seem two tesla cyber trucks already:
once when i was riding my bike and the other time near my school 
it sticks out so much lol"
Really really good video! Interesting POV.. and almost certain I've seen you driving around lol cheers mate!
"It feels like it might be remembered like the DeLorean DMC-12, unique look but gimmicky and a bitch to maintain as it ages."
This intro was probably the best I ever seen from a MKBHD video
"Interestingly, I think one car that would match the Cybertruck in going from Iconic to commodity would be the original Model S. Being one of the first electric cars on the road at the time I remember how special it was to see one, but now no one really sees the Model S as that cool."
Me:ü´† aimlessly looking for my cyberpunk in the larking lot filled with cybertrucks
"Iconic?  Naaah.  Badly designed, yes!"
macbook with a bloated battery
21:00 I assume he means Roll and Pitch?
The best thing about your car reviews is that you talk about them like a normal consumer and not like a car freak
"I dont think ""behave"" is the word...theyre thinking "" another one got duped"""
"No mention of the rust problem? Nothing impressive about a three motor electric vehicle accelerating quickly. This feels like a shill review. Outside novelty and shock value, it's a really poor product. Disappointed in this review..."
"I havent even seen one on the road but I'll assume its some asshole in it. Its neat and I like it but yeah not really sure what it is about it, just feels like a dickhead mobile."
"Chooses to drop it same day as Doug, coincidence?"
Nah! Its ugly
Paid review
Fun fact: I drive a PT Cruiser
Cybertruck is so cool but not a single person should buy it
a tin can on wheels
"Damn, he didn‚Äôt even get into the interior seating. That back seat doesn‚Äôt seem like the space of a full size truck, and would have loved to see MKBHD sit in the back with his height, just for perspective."
"I have this concern with lots of cars, but I think this thing is going to kill people. Any car it hits is going to be mangled and the cyber truck will not absorb much of the impact because of its steel exterior."
Is this sponsor content?
VW bug is iconic and mass produced
"God I really hope you're wrong about other manufacturers copying from this steaming pile. Tesla is quickly becoming the Apple of cars. Making awful decisions that everyone else gets saddled with because cultists will buy them anyway, and then the rest of the industry goes ""Wait, we can get away with that now?!"" so the rest of us get shafted."
"This video looks incredible, amazing work by the team."
I cant understand all the hate around the F150.. Like its some enormous tank. Its a half ton pickup?? I mean I understand beating up raptor/superduty/dually/excursion/etc owners.. But the F150? Its a glorified ranger......
i like it cuz its diff screams gen z
Missing the old MKBHD when he reviews affordable tech that can be bought by the masses
This is one of the best made videos I've ever seen from you guys.
It lacks Fang Sui. Too many sharp corners.
Bro wrappp ittttt
"Trendy, not iconic."
I love Marques just low-key flexing his Porsche just cuz
"I saw one on the road today in Salem Oregon. It was vinyl wrapped in pearl white, yeah it was still ugly."
"I saw it recently, and I thought it looked dope."
"It's ugly.

It's just novel and expensive.

But it's ugly."
This video feels like a new era of MKBHD. The way you speak and the way you sound more enthusiastic is just different from the usual you. Amazing video!
Can you compare what was promised vs what was delivered I remember there was gonna be no wipers and something else to move the rain out of the way
My main question is... What is the insurance policy on this thing? ü§î
"Marques, the car does not have to be rare to be iconic. The 57 Chevy, the 64 Mustang, the 70 Chevy Chevelle SS, and to a much lesser  extent the 90 Accord as this was the first vehicle many of us had that could exceed 100,000 miles with everything working and no problems."
Next we would like to see Xiaomi SU7 üòä
Iconic is such an overused word though.
I don't know if a 'Refrigerator-on-Wheels' could be considered iconic...
"The proper comment for this video :
Booy if you don't stop"
I look to validate I would never buy such an uguly thing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
you look like the kinda guy who would move to missagua
Nobody bats an eye in the Bay area though
The ugliest car ever
Felt like a commentary than a review but the video is still good.
putting on a motorcycle helmet for an amateur drag race is corny af
"I think it will remain an icon of vehicles. It didn't just push the design envelope but the engineering and drive experience envelopes as well. Context makes an icon, rarity can be a factor of the context, but it isn't the sole factor. And as long as most cars don't follow its design language it will also continue to make a visual statement."
I love charts.
"Turbo S vs base 992.1 Tesla used is a world of difference 

Also like 2.5x the price"
The cybertruck solves an important problem today: lack of attention.
Bro reviewing the halo CE warthog
"Yep, when I get my Cyberbeast Cybertruck, I'll trick it out and drive it mostly on the street.  Also, I want my hubcaps!"
"I thought Tesla updated the top speed on the Cybertruck to 130 in a software update. If you‚Äôre topping out at 114, something seems off."
"Saw my first live one in LA last week. Ugly on paper, film and real life‚Ä¶"
"It looks terrible, it‚Äôs like a peace of stove üòÖan unfinished prototype vehicle, not worth it. 100k for a huge battery with wheels"
"This thing like any other large American truck is a death trap to pedestrians and cyclists. It looks like a fridge, which I actually kinda like. But its bad for safety for everyone else except its occupants"
Things you don‚Äôt mention besides build quality 1. Finger cutting trunk hood 2. Bad charge curve 3. Under delivered range 4. No rain sensor 5. No stalks 6. No spare tire 7. Too expensive. F150 is a much better deal now that it can charge at supercharger. You review consumer electronics very well but way to go as a car reviewer.
üëèüëèüëè
"7:30 i feel this would have been a good moment to point out the glaring issue that the cybertruck does not have crumple zones and so if someone does hit you, the amount of damage the other car will receive will most likely be catastrophic and deadly."
iconic but without the extra wheel for replacement. when suddenly the car need tyre replacement will only hope for the towing come quick or left staying there for hoursü§£ü§£ü§£
Such a high quality content. Thank God for putting MKBHD in this generation.
Tesla finally fixed the problem of haters keying your car‚Ä¶üòÇ
"Even construction contractors usually have a diesel truck to tow at work or their powersports, and a luxury pick up truck to go out with their families on the weekends. People are throwing hate at the Cybertruck because its basically just a new concept. In few months/years we all gonna see these trucks everywhere."
Introüî•üî•
"I recently found out that my town which is Redding, California has the oldest dragstrip in the country and I thought that was actually pretty cool. Great video man."
That windshield tint goes HARD
The hammer threw me out xD
"now they should shrink it down and make cybercoupe xD Like the same design and proportions more less could easily work as a coupe, just lowered, shortened, and less wide"
The PT was ugly then and ugly now that they tried to ride the ZZTop hype.  CyberTruck is way cooler and a game changer.
What? No geese!    The Cybertruck will never be the same.
Should have a tactical aircraft pilot try out the steering. Get their opinion on the response. Really needs to be a conversation about that door staining 7:41
People are taking pictures because of MKBHD
Another video from the kingüëè
It's gonna Rust buddy
"Let's hope we don't have a solar apocalypse, because the system trunk as you to go vehicle won't work"
"Steering by wire is not new. Mustangs have had it for years.

The issues about the cyber truck not being capable is because Elon said it‚Äôs going to be the best off road vehicle ever. Going to better a Bahar vehicle."
Dude the reveal that he was going to drag race the truck vs the 911 porche was awesome. What a flex that you can just do that too haha
JUST IMAGINE THIS WAS HOW CHEMISTRY CLASS WAS THOUGHT.. SOO INSIGHTFUL . NEVER WANTED A VIDEO TO END LIKE  THIS ONE.
Why is he wearing a Germany's frisbee sport association jersey? great analysis about a machine that will make tons of money for a while. From gullible buyers... it will calm down...
"It's a running billboard, but in this case you got a money from it instead of spent on it"
This Cybertruck battery Capacity is INSAAANE! It is a whole powerhouse on wheels.
I dig it ! üëåüëç
I predict that the Cyberbeast will get wrapped sooner than later.
"They are not looking at the car, they are looking at the idiot that bought it."
"""Just because you're unique doesn't mean you're useful"""
"The anwser to your question is we went from cool nice cars, to more functional and now we are slowly going back to more asthstetic cars instead of just functional as the cars over the past 24 years have been a bit shut looking in design"
Pitch
this video üíØüëÄ The camera work and editing. Perfect
How does it feel to be responsible for a manufacturer to go bankrupt üòÇ
"It doesn't have to be pretty to be cool! The Cybertruck is ugly, but it's crazy and cool at the same time and I would buy one because of that if it was a perfect EV! It's not."
what a sick video
So Miles is your son!
Low-key two CTs?
Honestly the look is growing on me. I like it
It doesn‚Äôt look good at all in my opinion.
Marques won the race because Miles doesn't want to wreck the bosses car.
that intro was downright cool!
Looks like Quake
"Cybertruck may be the first truck with steer by wire, but certainly not the first production car. Last year even Toyota released the Lexus RZ450e (even had a yoke)."
The Cybertruck is cool and all... But gaahhdammnn... The video production was just... Wow... You killed it Marquez... üéâ
nj roads need better tires
I drove by the Tesla factory in Austin today and saw a ton of cybertrucks.
Here I was thinking he was about to pull a Tommy gun fron the back
Does the variable steering make It do the cybertruck can't drift?
amazing Intro video
Bulletproof stainless steel is very underrated.
They made the stainless durable and it ended up being bulletproof by accident btw üòÇüî•
Why not... we had iconic looks with the Studebaker and Edsel... but I still dun want one. Rather walk.
"I really like the front end but still dislike the rear. ¬†

I think you were incorrect in saying this truck is bulletproof up to 9mm rounds.  A .45 caliber round is larger and won't penetrate this truck, okay because this round is slower.  And, a .50 caliber round will penetrate it, yeah because it's faster.  But you were still incorrect in sayin ""up to"" a 9mm round.  There are rounds smaller than the 9mm that will go right through the Cybertruck, because of how fast they are.

And why would you use a sledge hammer on that truck?!  Stainless steel can still scratch.

I'm really interested in accident repair costs, because insurance rates are based on this.  Doesn't really matter how safe the vehicle is, it's all about what it costs to repair.  And I doubt many Tesla ""certified"" body shops have any experience working this metal.

Tesla completely mislead the public with their drag race and Elon specifically said the Cybertruck won the quarter mile race.  And that is the big deal, that Elon lied.  Some will say he misspoke...no, he flat out lied."
"The 911 has been around for decades. It is not rare. It is truly iconic. The Cybertruck isn't iconic so much as it is divisive. Eye-catching for some, eyesore for others."
This was probably one of the best cybertruck reviews on YouTube period. It highlights the features that no one mentions and put things in perspective no one thought of. Excellent work.
This is one of the Best Videos you've done!
2:05 new meme template guys
"Musk money was talking via Marques mouth this time. People modify other trucks to be the parking lot princess, but Tesla built this as a princess to begin with."
That was your best video ever made ‚ù§
"26:12 ""So it's kinda hard to find something both mass produced and iconic""... the original Volkswagen beetle was exactly that."
You use to warn us Marques and now it's a reality. its bulletproof right?
Bullet proof and HFS Is actually underrated Marquez. When a another car crashes into your cybertruck you will understand
Cybertruck doesn‚Äôt deserve to be sitting next to that beautiful 911.
The first colourful iMac is iconic and was mass-produced.
Very well made video!
The Cyber Truck is FUGLY!!!
"When the cyber truck was first announced that it was stainless, my first thought was how genius... it's probably the same stainless used to make starship which would probably get Tesla a better price on the material"
"If they make the back end of this thing shorter, or turn this into an SUV instead of a pickup.. it‚Äôll look so fire"
"The bots are out in force with the comments here .... ""The writing, the editing, the cinematography, the sound design"" ""The script writer is under-rated."" Bots. 

I'm not sponsored or on the payroll. ¬£66,000 for an electric whatever for something that looks like a Dairylea Triangle. Advertised 340 miles which means 220 (ish) miles in the real world. No use in the real world, don't fall for it folks ....."
And MKBHD continues to be  the number one reason I'm a youtube premium subscriber.
the graphics on this one were crazzyyyy!!!
The quality of this video is... just incredible. Love it! Thank you üôè
that was a really good review. well done
This feels like a movie
Wait the 911 walk and talk reveal was so sick üî•
5 minutes into this and his comment about Tesla being the first to do steer by wire already tells me I'm wasting my time by watching the rest of this fan boy hand job of a video. Fly by wire has been in service since the late seventies early eighties. Come back when you have original points to make.
How is it repaired in an accident or is it just totaled ?
13:22 this transition was sick af
brother ngl for the first time this feels a bit sponsored
Really good video but F150 is not a towing truck
Amazing ‚ù§‚ù§
"Drove one today, amazing‚Ä¶ really great product"
This should be in autofocus
"maybe im going crazy but dude this audio is so sharp, the S's are cutting into my head its genuinely painful and hard to watch"
I think Lexus was the first one to add steer-by-wire
Hoping they make a Cybervan
You missed the point that just a normal Tesla seemed out of reach for most people but now are so affordable even I have one. This new truck will be out of reach for a few years for most people but then we will see it everywhere.
The CyberTruck looks sick though definitely not for everyone. However there seems to be a huge correlation with people politically disagreeing with Elon & thinking it‚Äôs ugly.
The cybertruck is the French Bulldog of cars in terms of looks‚Ä¶
There's a new king of gender affirming care truck on the road üòé
"okay  mkbhd needs to stop these bland videos about hype , hype is the last thing we would want you to talk about"
The truck looks like a car from an 90s Playstation game. Low simple graphics. I love it.
"amazing vid, milestone. well done. big one."
"Mommy mommy look look 
Somebody actually buy it

Sssshht child
They think they're cool
Let me take a picture"
"Great, hard work shows in the quality of the review. You'll have to do another one when all of the updates happen (your Porsche may not like it)."
"Millions of cybertruck users, i doubt about it,  im not gonna say it will be as popular as model 3&y that much. If it does, it will take a long long route."
"In person looks? I finally saw one a week ago, at night tho. I WANT ONE!!! It looks so much better in person! Is it good at ""truck stuff"" probably not BUT! I don't care! It's so different! Like a Lamborghini Countach in the 70's. A space ship for the road. It's crazy cool! DO WANT!"
The intro is dopeüî•üî•
"Good to see Marques taking the time out to review cars from startups such as Fisker Vinfast and now this Tesla brand, I am sure all of their stocks are pretty high after his review"
"The comment that all the tech/advancements get overshadowed by the design, for better or for worst, probably does the most justice to the Cybertruck. Great video!"
I don't know WHY YOU CALL THIS YOUR BEST VIDEO EVER!?
Elon ask you to not mention the finger remover frunk lol
Looks incomplete üòÇ
"Not much of a car guy (I'm happy as long as my vehicle is dependable), so the Cybertruck (or any truck or SUV) is overkill for me.  That said, I do appreciate your analysis of the Cybertruck and its many innovative features.   There's much more going on with this vehicle than I had imagined.  I'm not ever going to buy a Cybertruck, but I'm hopeful that some of this tech (like drive-by-wire) will be widely adopted in the near future."
"the car is very ugly, but interesting to look at tho"
bruh that intro
As a cyclist every EV should get a thumbs up. Or would we rather chew on diesel exhaust and 20 year old cars with completely clogged catalytic converters? EV exhaust is sweet nectar for the lungs by comparison.
I when down from NorCal to SoCal 3 times this past month to see family and every single time I saw a trailer hauling about 5 or 6 cybertrucks down Interstate 5. Just a funny observation üòÖ
"This might be the greatest car review video ever made, by anybody. MKBHD just does it better."
The production quality has gone up several notches great work @mkbhd and team
It is a crime to not tint the driver and passenger windows‚Ä¶.
The music and editing. Damn.
"Yes yes people don‚Äôt buy pickups to do ‚Äúpickup work‚Äù every time they use it.  Just like people don‚Äôt buy Corvettes to drive as fast as they can on windy roads at ever moment they are driving it.  There many such examples of buying vehicles that others say you don‚Äôt need.  It is a really bad argument.  We buy pickup trucks for the possible need of their utility at some point in the future.  
Yes, sadly we don‚Äôt buy Ducati Panigale‚Äôs to drag our knees and elbows around every corner - so you are dumb to buy it‚Ä¶ is not a good argument. ;-)"
"I disagree re: wearing off .. at Christmas I rented a Model Y Performance and drove to Connecticut from NYC picking up family along the way, and some of my relatives were not familiar and very excited about it, even though I ride in the Model Y constantly in NYC in rideshares .. I think the Cybertruck has a very long runway before it becomes common with everyone in America because some people, perhaps a lot of people, just aren‚Äôt in proximity to the city centers where they will be more common :)"
"The writing, the editing, the cinematography, the sound design‚Ä¶ you all killed this. Shoutout David, shoutout Ellis, shoutout Brandon, and anyone else I‚Äôm missing that worked on this. What you guys are making is honestly head and shoulders above the rest right now. I‚Äôm a frequent watcher but rare commenter, keep it up everyone, you‚Äôre inspiring me!!!"
The script writer is under-rated.
I finally saw one. It looks amazing from the front side but not the back
10:04 Optimus Prime chilling in the back
Where'd they find the mini Marquez stig?
"Driving in sf Bay Area I have seen one pretty much everyday during my commute, given my commute is long but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rare anymore. Remember back in 2012 Tesla model S was a celebrity car people will take pictures of it also, now no one gives it a 2nd look."
It's so ugly

what's the point of having a bullet proof body when the glass is not bullet proof. it feels like a marketing gimmick
Other trucks have definitely been stuck in the snow. I live in Michigan there's no vehicle I haven't seen stuck
you can tell dude was triggered about the 911 video xD. Thanks for the info.
What if the max speed of the CYBRTK was increased to above 114 mph?
"Why not mention other iconic mass produced cars? Jeep Wrangler, Volkswagen Beetle, Mini Cooper, or even more upscale, the 911? These iconic cars are not only common, they have been around and common for a long long time.

PT Cruiser was an alright example, but that was mostly just profiting off the design of the Prowler which was in the dealerships at the time as a neutered automatic V6 design showpiece.

People are coming around on the Prowler now, though. So maybe we're just now finding out how cool that iconic design really was."
"I agree I think it‚Äôs dope iconic but like the design might get old to people when there is a bunch of them because it‚Äôs just so cool, but it is gonna wear off if they see five a day"
the meat riding is crazy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"To bring such BALANCE, across such a broad range of precursors, projections and perspectives is amazing. To do it so consistently is astonishing. You, and your team, are peerless in the work you do - iconic, I think."
"this has become a full blown car channel, wow, what a progress for mkbhd. starting from simple smartphones. and while other tech youtubers are stuck in the same rut or have lost relavance Marquess is growing his interests and personality."
"when you say that online opinions are mostly negative... that seems to be an ""internet"" thing more thn a cybertruck thing"
"This is not minimum engineering to meet market needs.  THIS IS maximum engineering.  Not built by accountants, but engineers.  Love it.  Now, please produce right hand drive CT's and import to Australia.  I want one."
"The CT looks unreal, kinda like pyrite in nature!"
The PT Cruiser still looks cool.
It's such a unsafe car they have to make fundamental changes to sell it in Europe. Not to mention the poor fit and build quality in all Tesla's. You can't fix the car you own. Tesla can also turn off any feature they want at anytime. I'll stick with a petrol/diesel car. Also Tesla faked it's towing drag race! Another lie from Tesla and Musk!
People only say bad things because it's different from what they're used to. This car definitely is a head turner.
"When VW first relaunched the Beetle back in 1998, I got to drive one around for a couple weeks before they were in any dealer show rooms.  It had the same affect, people in front of me would slow down and pull to the side so that I could pass them to get a better look at it.  People would come talk to me about it when I parked it doing errands, etc. I think that is the comparison point between iconic and newness.  The Beetle shape is iconic because no one really made a car that looked like it.  Cybertruck is the same in that way.  But eventually no one paid any attention to it because they were everywhere."
buying it someday. (manifesting)
I bet the steel also makes the crash way more jarring than cars with modern crumple zones
"Wow, F150 owners don't use their truck to tow. Who would know! Maybe G owners don't offroad, or Ferrari owners race."
I pray you'll get to own a GT3 RS
"A few comments on the Cybertruck v 911.  It was a gimmick, we all know. The cheapest 911 still cost more than a Cybertruck, especially after options.  I wonder how the Cybertruck would fare of it was wasn't speed limited by software and had road tires instead of all terrain tires?üòä"
Excellent video
Tesla touts itself for being eco friendly but they don't acknowledge the amount of plastic and other virgin material they use that is entirely made with the help of petro chemicals and the extensive level of mining is envolved. Tesla is a good company but the way they present themselves as the future of green vehicles and the future will be all electric seems incorrect and misleading
Cybertruck isn't the first to introduce SteerbyWire Toyota was the first one
"So the drag race was deceptive marketing. Whatever people say, I think the cyber truck is a cool concept car, but it is not a practical design. It just isn‚Äôt safe for pedestrians. The touchscreen operated drive controls are irksome. We know Tesla isn‚Äôt known for quality control so if something fails, this has the potential to cause serious injury to those around."
Man your videos look gorgeous on LG C1 at 4K wow
63% is the opposite of 37 :-0
This is a movie bro üòé
"Excellent video, the best so far about CT. Congrats!"

talk about xiaomi su7 its officially released yesterdayü§°ü§°ü§°
bro sold out hard for this one. He is even removing comments that talk negatively on that ‚Äútruck‚Äù
mines on back order rn. just waiting for the email to put down the rest of my depositüò¢
This was a lot better than what ever that last cybertruck video was
its funny how you can realise certain things as you grow up. i still remember how obsessed were you with teslas.
Pt cruisers are not regular cars. They are weird cars lol.
I love it üìê
What an intro üî•
imagine if you paid 100k for a pt cruiser
"You should do a video on the Chrysler Prowler, actually saw one the other day, guy had really fat tires in the back and bigger tires up front and I think it was lowered but it looked sick. I'm not a car person but I think it's another unique car possibly modeled after the pt cruiser"
"You rarely see a Tesla car in my country, so I always gaze when I see one"
I saw one in houston . The truck looks much better in person than on video.
25:56 insane shot
"The biker was giving a thumbs down because the rate of pedestrians being murdered by drivers has increased dramatically w size of vehicles. In the hands of thousands of average drivers, this rocketing sci-fi tank paints a frightening, avoidable future."
That intro was sick!!!
I hate electric cars i am a gas guy and i was hating heavy when i first saw it online then i saw it in person and it is pretty sweet i like them alot more now
"The name of the car - Cybertruck - sells and is brilliantly invented. If the name of the car were Ikea-auto or from a Chinese song: 7's burns, then these would describe the car's appearance better. Cybertruk's 9 mm thick shells are convincing, but the abundance of plastic parts goes to the other extreme: the bumpers and skirts are made of the same black plastic. I wouldn't dare go off-road with such a plastic car. Tesla's innovations are indeed brilliant in their implementation, like now, for example, digital control and swiveling rear wheels, to name a few."
It‚Äôs time for a back to the future remake
"You will be seeing the Cyber truck strapped to the inside of the heavy lift rocket along with his robots, where they will be driving it on Mars and building a habitable space for humans to come later."
Tesla isn't the first one to introduce steer by wire. I believe it was first introduced by Lexus in one of their SUVs.
It‚Äôs f***ing horrible!
I got a feeling that it's more deadlier to pedestrians compared to normal shaped vehicles in case if they got hit in an accident. All those shape edges ....

Appreciation comment because musk is busy. üòÖ
Ok honestly I think if they leveled the sides around the bed so it was more useable for regular truck uses but kept the rest of the body profile the same it would look better and be more useable Idk though
This video is way too apologetic for an expensive vehicle with common issues Tesla should've fixed long ago ‚Äî panel gaps still? Come on.
"Roll & pitch, not yaw."
Cringe intro
"its one the most beautiful ugly cars i have ever seen in the past 30 years of my life, would drive for a day but wouldnt buy if I could afford it"
Being iconic doesn't require it to be rare. The VW Beetle is iconic despite being one of the most mass-produced cars of all time.
I imagine the CT as having the Mercedes G Wagon story arc.
Bro I saw a cyber truck on the road the work the other day and it‚Äôs super dope to see it in the streets. Actually bigger than you think it is.
The VW beetle was a mass produced iconic car

"5:00 variable steering ratio implemented by Honda in the S2000, in 2000. TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. tesla DID NOT invent this."
in order to make car in usa and be able to compete with around the world factory new ev brand include tesla need to make it to have less assemble so less total parts. that's fine until u got into an accident. your insurance pay but then it will go up in price next year that is what many ppl dont account into the money to buy and maintenance the car
this feels like a wes anderson movie! great job guys!
"Great video as always, MKBHD!!!"
"Tesla will definitely make a key fob for the Cybertruck.  They have more important things to worry about at this time. The 3, Y, S, and X all have key fobs. I will never carry a key fob around. My phone is good enough."
"It's not the design. It's the optics and politics attached personally to Elon. You're driving a car made by an asshole, and as a result you're assumed to BE an asshole."
10:03 wait a minute...that drum line sounds familiar.
"Oh, I'm so sick of hearing about the Cybertruck."
The front looks like a Cylon. I like that.
Ok I don‚Äôt know about the looks or the design of the Tesla cyber truck üõª but the way of MKBHD making the videos like action movies is mind blowing ‚ù§
The majority of people that hate it rn are hating on it because they have wild political beliefs that they let dictate the every day interactions with people and inanimate objects
"As for collision safety, aren‚Äôt cars crumpling in crashes now to absorb impact? Rather than being rigid and unyielding, sending us blood bags bashing harder into the walls and dash than in the crumpling cars??"
"4:50 You can tell marques isn‚Äôt a car guy. Infiniti shipped steer by wire in the Q50 in 2014. TEN YEARS AGO. Lexus did steer by wire in RZ last year. When Tesla does anything, it‚Äôs amazing innovation, they‚Äôre the first. When any other company does it, nobody cares or knows. It‚Äôs all marketing fluff. The key though is that this marketing WORKS, even on half savvy people like marques."
Fantastic video
The reactions are basically the same as some people spotting a Toyota fortuner/land cruiser in IndiaüòÇ
"So do I gotta be the first one to say how MKBHD is a sellout and how the cyber truck is complete dog shit like it‚Äôs a cool car don‚Äôt get me wrong or truck or EV but be honest for $100,000 and no hubs is pretty bad less then 500 miles of range üòÇ"
"The one thing I enjoy about Mkbhd is that sometimes Marques sits and talks to you, like you‚Äôre having a direct conversation. I love this."
Nice portable fridge.
Bro intro is like a music video
Comments section that has petrolheads going yup the 911 is a better buy üòÇüòÇ
Love the minimalism
Reminds me of a very expensive trash bin.
"""Dumptruck vibes""
_Exactly._"
Best video yet!!! Awesome job man!
I‚Äòll do one one like for every comment this push-up gets.
"Its uglyness is part of its appeal.

That story about the biker giving a thumbs down is hilarious. It actually made me laugh out loud."
If you lose power how does the steer by wire work?
"When he said, ‚Äúmany people will just use this truck and that‚Äôs fine‚Äù, as an urban planner I felt shivers down my spine. These trucks look super dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists and small cars. I sincerely hope I don‚Äôt get to see them in my city"
What happened to the built in ramp in the tail gate that they loaded the quad with during the unveiling?
The cyber truck creamed a a base level 911. The reality is the 911 lost period
"People think it's worth 300,000 USD because they think that thing is packed with high tech. Which is not really the experience that the Cybertruck provide."
"Driving a Model 3 for the past three years; I now HATE buttons for the simple things such as volume, trunk charging and darn near everything else.  The lack of physical buttons, replaced with the touch screen is amazing.  I now dislike driving cars that don't have those features, so buttons over-rated, touch screen under-rated."
250k people were guessing? Ill take things that didnt happen for $1000 Alex.
Wish you had talked about the pedestrian danger of this uncrumpleable material. Or  the environmental impact of using a larger vehicle than you need. Use your platform to inform folks of the harm they can cause to others please!!
It‚Äôs not just Tesla. It‚Äôs a known thing with any manufacturer to not get a vehicle when I first comes out. Why is Tesla singled out
Garbage
You think it‚Äôs designed to be use on Mars eventually?
That intro was EPIC!!
Hi Elon
Give us back our buttons!!
Is it an iconic shape? For sure. But it really only attracts a crowd depending where you are. Out here in LA you see plenty of Cybertruck‚Äôs as well as exotic cars so it doesn‚Äôt attract a crowd at all.
"Love your reviews.Clear, to the point, very informative and even handed. Even though I'm not a tekkie, I understand you. Thank you."
The VW beetle is a good comp.
The most underrated feature of the cyber truck is the 48 V electrical system. It makes everything else possible. Streb wire requires dual 5 kw motors for the front and another one for the rear. None of that would be possible without the smaller cabling made possible by the 48 volt system.
That thing will never be regulated to cruise on Europeans roads lol. Just the intro. lol.
"It needed 3.7 seconds to hit 60 mph and 11.7 seconds to complete the quarter-mile at 127 mph.

2023 Porsche 911 Turbo.
Cyberbeast < 11.
So cybertruck is still more fast and quick.
2023 Porsche 911 Carrera S 
0-60mph 3.9 sec. quarter mile drag time is 12.1 sec
cybertruck 0-60mph 2.6 sec and >11 sec"
"Iconic design, mass produced:

Beetle
Mini Cooper
Fiat 500
911
Wrangler
Lada Niva
Volvo 'the brick'
Yugo"
Awesone!
The content itself was incredibly interesting (as it usually is!) but the production quality was absolutely off the charts. Huge shoutout to the whole team.
That design is gaudy. I never would have thought of it as minimalist.
iconic for sure!
"This was not the first steer by wire car, that would go to Infiniti."
That bare minimum shoutout to Engineering Explained was definitely a choice I guess
That intro üî•üòç
"I think this truck's legacy is just going to be the most pavement princess truck ever concieved and I'm saying that as someone who actually really digs its aesthetics. Not to mention all the reports of panel rust after being exposed to a bit of rain.

The Cybertruck is the ""oh no, my hair is wet"" of trucks lol

also just seems super dangerous and irresponsible"
Chrysler 300 was like this when it came out
4:56 they are not the first one to do it. I believe a Lexus model introduced it first to a production car
The VW Beetle is also iconic and it was the most mass produced vehicle of its time.
"If Elon wasn't a horrible person, I might consider one. I just can't support him in any way."
"Believe it or not but guys, the whole thing is overrated as a pickup truck..."
Needs much less Elon. Like zero.
This is the stupidest review I‚Äôve seen
"Hardly anyone uses trucks for truck stuff anymore, they just use them to go to kroger and terrorise the streets. People just love to hate on the cybertruck"
Oooo intro......
"Tesla is lucky as it is a vehicle manufacturer not a truck manufacturer.  Cybertruck is a niche  vehicle.  It can try new engineering which could end up in their main vehicles.  Ford and GM trucks are their bread and butter.  Little more difficult.  Tesla started before high inflation, high interest rates, and high debt.  All these newer companies/startups  are fighting huge debt loads on top of high interest rates.  Even Big 3 falling in this category.  Starting to see oversupply of vehicles dealer lots especially $75-$100,000 trucks/Suv‚Äôs, LOT ROT.  Credit card debt highest level 1.3 trillion.  Government still overspending and buying more debt with 35 trillion in debt. L"
So definitely a fanboy. The Fisker got destroyed and this was engineering quirks. In the whole review didn't talk about the truck can't really get wet or touched without possibly rusting
Tesla‚Äôs are the only vehicles that will get better over time.
Marques I saw your tweet saying that you thought this was the best video you have ever made. This video has lived up to it. Awesome job!
This will wear off in a few months.  And you‚Äôll be stuck with a 100k refrigerator.
I am completely blown away by the quality and production of this video. Insane!!!!!!
Yes most trucks will not be in work or off road but the thing is they are still very capable vs not being able to do so but i like the fact you seperated quick vs fast
"They actually did the GT three RS, which which is the perceived fastest one but it‚Äôs actually much slower than the turbo S in the quarter-mile"
I saw one today and was like this shit is real.
I saw three on a carrier and didn't crash because I've seen it online so much
"man...""too old to remember the PT Cruiser"" *Micheal Jordan voice* ""And i took that personally""."
"Now put both the 911 and the Cybertruck to do some laps, lets see who ends with wheels up first."
Cyberjunk
"The CyberTruck vs Porsche race that Tesla marketed was a bit disingenuous, but it's also to be noted that trailer tires are not rated to go at the speeds that would have been reached in a full quarter mile. They literally couldn't have done a full proper quarter mile, even if they wanted to show that it would lose."
"Other examples of automotive mass produced icons are the Volkswagen Beetle and Bus (originals), Morris Mini, 60‚Äôs Ford Mustang, Citroen 2CV and DS and Fiat 500 (original).  We just haven‚Äôt had so many lately because cars have become commoditised, iconic design is risky, and why would large established manufacturers take risks on manufacturing a commoditised product?"
This level of shilling without a single deep thought is enough to warrant finally unsubscribing.
"Anyone considering this truck should also look at a 4 cylinder Tacoma. My dad has a 2015 access cab 2.7 Tacoma and we've used it for so many things. Hauling, towing, you name it. Of course nothing huge but most people don't need to transport something huge. Then when you use the truck for simple things, like a car would be used, it's small, efficient and simple. Any mechanic would know how to fix it. Bring back small trucks."
Ain't no damn cybertrucks
MADE IN USAüá∫üá∏BATTERY 4680 MADE IN USA Tesla Computer chips. Starlink WiFi  will end up in vehicles
"wow awesome video, awesome truck, awesome music!"
"It‚Äôs weird that Marques, who cut his teeth reviewing very subtle design objects like iPhones, can‚Äôt see the Cybertruck‚Äôs curves and facets. Most of the surfaces and edges on the truck have a subtle curve, and the whole vehicle is faceted to create a sense of power and action - which is why ‚Äúit‚Äôs better in person‚Äù is a thing. The Cybertruck is undeniably a masterpiece of Modernist design, and it‚Äôs become my litmus test for whether people who claim to know design have actually studied the emergence of industrial design theory and practice in the early 20th Century or are just parroting whatever sensibility was in fashion when they started their working."
Can we give cudos to the editor for that intro!
The INTRO!!
Bulletproof is overrated since most drive by shooters dont shoot at the door pannels they go for the windows which are not bulletproof at all üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Great video, and thank you!!!"
14:18 is he MKBHD's brother üòÇ
Shouldnt this be in auto focus?
Its the Vision Pro of trucks lol
Best reviewer in the game.
Hands down one of the best vehicles ever built
"The only reason I wouldn't buy this model is due to the fact that it's a first iteration.
Knowing how Tesla operates, Elon and his engineering team will make the second and third edition more practical or pleasing to potential customers.  It definitely will get better over time. üöç"
6:51 One of those moments where I realize that outside of all the tech videos with amazing editing and car reviews and outside of all the serious business things Marques does... at the end of the day he's just a child inside like the rest of us lol.
Great video Team ! thank you
Tesla msrp pays for superchargers.  Competitors throw that on taxpayers and other private companies.  Teslas FOTA AND SOTA OTA updates still a dream for other competitors.  Many Tesla charging stations supplemented with solar and battery storage.  Undercutting competition costs/kwh .  Tesla/space x software/hardware/metals are way ahead.  Even NASA has commented on their hardware/software feats.
Any production car that runs in the 10s is amazing.
I imagine for the people who've never heard of the Cyber Truck they are even more surprised that it's a Tesla. I can imagine you showing this off to someone in a random parking lot and pointing to a Tesla Model S or 3 and explaining that the same company is behind both
Have you been dubbing your voice in some of these last vids?
I wonder how much insurance is on that truck in NY since NY is a tax paradise for owning a car üòÇü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
might be apt to compare to one of the most iconic phones; the iphone 5s. I don't know if that design ever got boring to be honest.
"This truck has 1 degree of attractiveness. All other 359 degrees, ugliest thing on the road."
Anyone know the brand of hoodie Marques is wearing in this video?
"Bro, it's not the car. It's you!!!  Lol"
"When Model 3 deliveries started they maxed out at just 120 kW. Then they bumped it up to 150 kW. Then v3 Superchargers appeared with 250 kW, and all of a sudden all those Model 3s charged twice as fast as they did at launch. I‚Äôm confident Cybertruck charging will get much faster over time in much the same way."
Would putting a clearppf wrap help with finger prints üßê
as iconic as a ford pinto
14:38 Hey the Porche wasn't towing a cybertruck though lol
I see zombies in this video lmao ü§£ what is wrong with people?
Anyone know what hoodie Marques is wearing?
"Killer review! Thanks for all the creative effort you put into this video!

Also, I think it looks great, so üëçüòÅüëç"
This is your 3rd review of it in 3 months. It is definitely something
"I know the younger generations probably like this truck a lot. i have no doubt that it is state of the art, and its technology will probably be what other companies strive to produce, but I am sorry, this thing is UGLY UGLY, it reminds me to the futuristic vehicles in low budget 1980s sci fi movies. 
 I am not really into EVs but even if I were, this would never be a car that I would remotely consider. I think I would go for the Rivian."
"They ugly, if there were as many on the road as model X‚Äôs.
I live by a Tesla facility and have pulled up to a left turn lane and been surrounded by three

Felt like Luke in the trash compactor despite being in a full size Accord"
Your video and Doug‚Äôs are outstanding
"ITS NOT UGLY, IT BORING, but new and young, its not cyberpunk civilian , its cyberpunk army"
99% of people buy high end trucks because they're cool and this does that better than pretty much any of the competition right now. If you put aside the media controlled hate sheep that can't even afford one most people can't even believe it's on the road and think it's awesome. I think the public reactions in this video prove that further. People have been complaining forever that all modern cars look the same and finally someone comes out with something that's never been done before and I'm here for it. The endless waitlist for these says I'm not alone too. I think the biggest lesson from this thing has been it's really easy for the media to tell people what to think.
"For better or worse, it's something that only Tesla could have engineered and designed. I personally don't like the looks, but time will tell what the wider reception is going to be."
cybertruck is the new g wagon üåù
"It is ugly looking tbh, it just has a lot of tech on it thats all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
0:50 dope!
The top end speed for the cyberbeast is 130mph not 113. Something is wrong. Dual motor is 113
"You're wrong about ""iconic"" status being diminished by mass production.  The Beetle, 65 Mustang, 57 Chevy, Porsche 911s and C3 Corvettes are all genuinely iconic, yet mass produced.  It's mass exposure that gives birth to an icon.  Everyone must have an emotional connection.  Only car people know a Bugatti Veyron.  Super exclusive, yes. Icon, no."
That intro üòóü§åü§åü§å
"MKBHD, while I love your videos, you literally admitted that the Porsche isn't stock, come on dude. 45 seconds later you're nitpicking Tesla for doing something else in their video that isn't straight up. IRONIC if you ask me."
All the hate for the vehicle is really political. I can literally tell how one would vote by how strongly they feel about this truck.
Cringe car
All teslas are lighter than competitors
The CT is a good very stable short range tow vehicle.    With the range extender it will tow further.
It's only 80/20 in a Musk Fanboy's world.
Raptor sales will fall.  Gas cars seem overpriced now vs EV‚Äôs especially performance.
Using the 911 turbo s for your number is dishonest
Never thought I'd see Marques drag racing lol
"They are also increasing the rear wheel steering angle by 7 degrees, it will turn even tighter then."
because it looks so stupid? yup.
bro i drew this car when i was 7
"I think it looks really good purely for aesthetic purposes, however, due to the fact that I cannot stand Elon Musk, I dislike it by default."
Haha love that you pulled out a random hammer to just hit the car üòÇ
Truthfully all trucks and SUV‚Äôs should be limited to 100 mph.  So much turbulence  and air under vehicles makes for partial airplane especially with high center of gravity/high ground clearance.  Very easy to lose control or high speed..  so many roll overs in SUV‚Äôs/trucks.  Stability control mandated all new vehicles starting 2012 to help mitigate roll overs.  EV harder to roll secondary to low heavy battery.  Legacy auto has even tried to shave metal off roof sections to help lower center of gravity and prevent roll overs but now you have weak roofs that can collapse easier if roll over
Not the first vehicle with steer by wire. Some Infiniti models have had steer by wire for almost 10 years at this point.
"This is my honest opinion, not hate, I think that you should stick to tech/phone reviews, because your delivery is plasticky and sterile. You know someone is ""good car reviwer"" when you see passion, when manufacturer do something bad for the car you see frustation, when car is 0.1sec faster than manufacturer claim you see genuine excitement, like Matt Wattson or Car Tour and you have non of that. Also your presentation is sound so boring, because you don't wanna offend any big company, with your honest opinion in hope you still get sponsors and day 1 tech release, not like Linus Tech Tips who seams more genuine and care about end consumer of a product he reviews (I strictly remeber your video from few years back when you expressed that you want your videos to be more real and life like, but day buy day you stray further from that and you become more and more sterile and out of touch with real world, idk if that video is still up). Sorry for my bad english, it's not my first language and hope you read this and not delete this comment! üòá"
"Marques is better or just as good an auto reviewer as he is with consumer tech. His enthusiasm shines through with each video. Also, he definitely does not skim over the research."
The ugly of that thing is something to behold! LOL
What a video !!!!!!!!üòé
Probably...ü§îü§®
rusty panel gaps enter the chat.
Dbrand skin to hide the fingerprint for the beast coming up?
"Iconic?  Ridiculous, it is.  üòÇ"
I love the design. I‚Äôm sure it will end up in the a famous museum of design some day.
literally every new hyped car at release.
I think its iconic because of the design. Well everybody's making curvy cars/ aerodynamics. Tesla with the straightest lines and body choice. If there are more cars like this design it will die like the PT. But if no one does I think it will stay iconic.
I LOVE IT
"The amount of adults throwing a tantrum over this thing is wild.  üòÖ 

They act like they are being forced to buy one.   Like they could afford one in the first place lmao."
The vw beetle was and is iconic... so is the ct
The intro is madüò≠
"Hey marques, did you know in the center screen if you tap the window of the cybertruck twice, it shatters."
Most iconic shitbox is what this is. It doesn‚Äôt even qualify to be a carüòÇ
You guys are so good at making videos sheesh
Shouldn't this be uploaded on AutoFocus Channel??
"Dude, your production quality has always been too notch, but this video with all the edits with location and setting changes is edited so smoothly with the dialog. 

This is the best video of this truck by far!"
"Thank you, Great video."
"I mean I‚Äôm glad they made it just for fun, but whatever. I‚Äôve seen a few. A black one was parked in front of my house last night, visiting my neighbor I guess.  But after two years of hearing about it it‚Äôs just not very exciting. Yeah it looks funky, but it‚Äôs just kind of obnoxious and goofy."
"It is a movie or just a review of a car? Keep it up, man! Great video production"
The only thing that worries me is what happens to the innocent family when an affluent rich kid pummels them with this 7000 lb steel tank!?
"Cybertruck just doesnt translate well on video. Its so weird, but it looks way better in person"
When i think cybertruck i think tech on wheels. From these reviews. Seems as much tech as a premium tesla car
"Cybertruck is 7000 pounds with 123 kwh battery.  Hummer EV 10,000 pounds with 240 kWh battery.  Smaller battery weighs less, faster charging.  Less weight means better handling, braking, acceleration, and range."
With a frunk that will chop off your fingers if you don't watch your hand. Def an moronic disaster design.
Car looks great.  A lot of the people who say it's terrible are still upset about Elon buying Twitter.
Iconically gay
Hey mkbhd please add the metric info like meters/kilometers. Kilograms etc.  Your channel is watched worldwide.  It‚Äôs not just the United States. Watching from South Africa üáøüá¶
Goats üêê things
the most dangerous thing about this truck is that the company behind it. They are subject to so many lawsuits and other issues. Illegally dumping toxic waste. Internal racism against workers. Worker injuries. Sexual harassment.  Labor disputes. Horrible business.
Awesome video. Awful vehicle (imo)
That was not a panel gap and you should have known. Canoo has been doing steer by wire before Tesla
I usually ignore Tesla hate online because it comes from engine users that hate saving money on gas
Regarding iconic and rare - I would say the iPhone is iconic - and so is the Cybertruck.
"Gas motors are peaky.  They need to be in a certain rpm range for max horsepower let‚Äôs say 6000 rpm.  They need gears to help stay in that sweet sport.  Compromises on torque and or horsepower.  More rpm means more horsepower but sacrifices torque.  Electric motors full torque from 0 rpm.  Very torque rich through whole power band at 85% efficiency.  Gas  motors only 25% efficient as most energy given off as heat.  Similar comparing incandescent bulb vs led bulb.  Oil/gas is so cheap that inefficient gas engines are allowed.  Most car gas motors average 24 mpg vs EV‚Äôs over 100mpge.  75% of the drilling, pumping, shipping, refining, and transport of oil/gas thrown away to air, water, and land pollution. 450,000 oil refineries located in large cities worldwide causing 50% air pollution and 6 million deaths/year from FF pollution.  Grid is greener everyday.  No tail pipe emissions in front of you in traffic.  Storage batteries on the grid is the holy grail to supply/demand"
The way you used the truck lines to adjust the video composition inside the truck is insane.
I‚Äôve always loved how it looks but I keep that to myself most of the time cause people really don‚Äôt like that opinion.
Reviewer is so afraid to say bad things about this monstrosity because he does not want to offend the man child who owns the company.
so is no one gonna talk about how it doesn't crumple when it gets into an accident or that a shatterproof window is a bad idea if you have to escape the car for whatever reason? this thing has the dumbest design ever.
üêê
Just recognized Marques sporting a German Frisbee Association shirt at 15:15 üòÄ How come? :) Greetings from Germany ‚úåÔ∏è
I freaking love this thing!
Making the video somewhat particiaptory is a good touch
yeah look at me.  look at me.  about right in today's world...look at me
Thumbs up for the team for the excellent audio leveling and post on this one.
"I laugh when people get mad about the looks of the Cybertruck. If Tesla had made a cookie cutter truck design people would have bashed that. I am glad vehicle buyers have something truly different to buy if they want.

100% agree with the idea in a few years people will be less excited about seeing a Cybertruck. As something is more commonly seen, it becomes less jarring. 

As far as comparing it to the PT Cruiser, not a great comparison. That was a quick cash grab using a Neon platform and offering little, if anything innovative. I think the VW Beetle was ground breaking for it's time. That became very common, but I am sure when new it got attention. Engine in the back, very round, etc, was not common when it was new. I can only imagine the hate it got it when new. 

I guess mark a follow up video for 2027 to see how things turned out."
"17:09 ""My child - I mean...""

I'm not a parent, but I already know my kids won't run nearly as fast as Marques'"
"Great video as usual but a little disappointed you didn't touch on the safety implications of the design at all, both for occupants and other vehicles/pedestrians"
üéâüéâ
The CyberJUNK will never be iconic. It is junk today and will forever be junk.
10.9 1/4 mile is willld
"I saw one the other day.  it was awesome.  you can beat it up all you want.but, it's cool as fk."
Iconic? 100% agree but I think you missed why. Marques you compared its iconicness to other cars - poster cars. You 100% correct its rare now but not in a year or two. In a couple of years the Cybertruck will be just another car you pass on the road.  I think its icon status will come from its yet to be realized impact on the industry; more akin to the Ipone of 2007.
"Really cool tech, but too big for outside of the US and don't like the boxy look. I'd love Tesla to make Ford Ranger & Ford Maverick style ""trucks""/utes"
Haters gonna hate ü§°
14:03 The cleanest transition ever! We went from a Cybertruck review to the Fast and the Furious in two seconds!!üî•üî•üî•
The light and shadow on the white dash looks amazing with the textures and colours
I'm in a MKBHD video ü•á
"That intro was insane, the production is beautiful. Well done."
"Brilliant video!  I've seen a boatload of Cybertruck videos and they all seemed to have an ex to grind.  Not yours.  Extremely well organized and presented, and especially, very fair.  I didn't want the video to end.  Thanks!!"
"On that rarity comment. I hated the cyber truck, but but the more I see it the less ugly it looks. And it‚Äôs starting to look cool. üòÖ"
"Superb. Video. Period.

The comparison to the PT Cruiser is actually pretty brilliant. I'm old enough to remember when that came out and vaguely recall the divisive nature of its looks. If the Cybertruck racks up a similar production count, I could imagine a similar fate. Also, I'm really curious how the stainless steel survives after 1 year of ownership, particularly in wintery areas where road surfaces are salted. The stains in the ""stainless steel"" of the second truck were very apparent on video. This needs a future follow-up!"
The only reason Tesla put all those gigs on the cybertruck is to sell it at higher prices
Went aren't you just saying cyber truck has better Svensson acceleration and 911 has better top speed?
Anything about electric cars is not iconic.
"When I bought my 2016 F150 Lariat, it was my daily commuterüòÇ I felt like a king on the roads, coming from driving a dinky Ford Focus to that felt amazing. Its about 3-tons and literally has been used for hauling, dumping, some offroading, but zero towing. The utility of being able to load the bed to the brim with stuff is absolutely worth its size. Lots of friends, family, and neighbors have asked for my help getting their stuff from point A to point B. Owning a truck is great. Side note, I probably have the only 2016 F150 Lariat Sport Special Edition model in a 50 mile radius. They had to ship it from LA because there wasnt one in NorCal anywhere.

ps...my other cars are a Tesla Model S and a Mercedes GLE63 AMG....not getting rid of the pickup though! ‚úåÔ∏è"
If you need to tow something you would get a van
Crumple zone ... ?
I‚Äôm getting the cybertruck to haul goosenecks
Tesla model S is *still* iconic. So there's your answer.
video production quality is superb.
how much they paid ? shame
"The most quintessentially ""modern american"" vehicle. Big, flashy, inconsiderate of others, poorly manufactured and illegal in Europe!"
Iconic vehicles become iconic due to their influence not just style. The DeLorean is iconic because of back to the future not because of itself. If the cyber truck influences the industry it could become iconic. Right now it's just unique
Elon saw RoboJox and stole the idea from that movie lol
Looks like a stupid Minecraft car
It looks like a Boomers idea of future.
It looks like a Lamborghini Countach on steroids
Don‚Äôt know why anyone would buy this overpriced rust bucket when there are way better alternatives going around.
I love the shot at 10:05- in between 2 trucks ü§å
The intro song got me like üï∫üèøüï∫üèøüï∫üèø
"I wish someone drag races a standart 911 and not top of the line 911 turbo S.  It's not a surprise that a full on sports car wins against a truck, but it's still bonkers to say that a truck beats a porche 911, even if its a entry level model."
great video m
So 63% of truck drivers are responsible for the gas prices they bitch about.
"The hype around the cybertruck is purely asthetic, which is what Tesla intended. The range (especially when towing) is mediocre at best, and the bed is not very well shaped, sized, or even particularly accessible. It doesn't do a great job of being a truck, it's basically an EV muscle car with a truck bed."
Great review
"Hi Marques, good analysis, well balance video üëåüèæ"
10:05 'Truck Stuff' there's 2 trucks in this frame and the Cybertruck isn't one of them
"Wardrobe change midway in, like Taylor Swift.

Well played.

As far as the PT Cruiser, it was a failure for Chrysler. One of the worst vehicles ever made in all of American history. We don't know how well or not the Cybertruck is made but I'm pretty sure it'll be better than any PT Cruiser. Ever."
Great video
You online people is crazy
I was one of the first people in my area with a Model 3. Got very similar reactions at first.
"Ignoring the looks for a second, it doesn't even make sense for practical truck use."
"I remember when the hummer first came out,  most ppl hated it!"
I it's lowest suspinison level it looks slick
In 5 years it will be viewed as the joke that it is. Aztec 2.0
The intros of all time on youtube
The cybertruck will probably end up like the Volkswagen beetle or a minicooper. Very different and unmistakable. People will still point it out and say ‚Äúlook a cybertruck‚Äù but it will be normalized.
This is a cool truck with plenty of room for 5 and a large bed.
That intro was dope asf
"dayum. What a great youtube video. The presentation, the content, the main dude, the other dudes, the snazzy music and transitions. A solid 5/7"
I like it because it looks different we finally got a car that looks futuristic you see all these concept cars at these car shows and they never release them or they make them look different from what they originally showed
"I get that people rarely do truck thing with this truck... but for 76K... should it be doing truck stuff competently...? I feel like the excuse of it being a glorified SUV is fine... but Tesla IS advertising it as a pickup truck... and people buying pickup trucks do rely on it being a good pickup truck when they do need it to act as a pickup truck... so, I don't think it is unreasonable to criticize the fact that as a pickup truck... it is mediocre as best, and downright bad as worst...."
"I work at a grocery store for curbside pickup, and we had a cybertruck pull-up. Obviously, I took a picture. My coworkers took some pictures and talked about it, and a guy pulled over to take a picture of it. I agree, I think it's an icon as if now"
"I have friends that think trucks 4 wheel drive  can go through anything, not.  Many gas trucks very top heavy and easy to roll."
"I have seen this thing a few times here in Austin and no matter how many times I see it, it's still ugly. I would be embarrassed to be in it. It's horrible, it looks like it was made in someone's garage."
"Marques is so good at what he does, actually insane

Also Miles collab was nice surprise"
What a flex ‚Äúwhile we are here‚Äù with the Porsche love to see it üî•
steer by wire is cool and all until there is a electrical failure and you cant physically steer your own car
I know this car is ugly and I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm in love with the way it looks üòÖ‚ù§üòÖ
With so many trucks where are all the ranches?  Most of the beds not scratched
"Either your editing team has done a splendid job removing the echo or your mic has crazy clear echo cancelation, because HOW? Anyways fantastic video as always, loved it."
IT's not what I would have designed but it's a mold breaker and like it or not..........I love mold breakers.  Period.
"It's not like I'm trying to convince myself it's not good looking, it just isn't. When it was first unveiled, I did think it was cool. But even before the launch, it looked dated. The transition from prototype to production, is where it failed to deliver the promise.Technically it may be exceptional, but its raison d'√™tre is as a style setter, a brand ambassador. And then the stainless steel issues, which were core to its differentiation, only further dented the product value."
I am not a truck guy but interested in this truck
"'Dumptruck Vibes' - Marques Brownlee, 2024"
We have a raptor r and if you see this we should do some racing and off-roading to compare them. Like so he sees this
"The wealthy make things available for the masses later.  The wealthy investors know their are risks with new stuff and understand first few manufactured products  may have issues, production hell."
Iconically bad
Cyber junk
0:30 It‚Äôs not the cyber truck. It‚Äôs Marques üòÇ
My Gen X siblings referred to the PT Cruiser as the PT Loser.
Anything here that isn't about how criminally unsafe this killing machine is is dogshit naiveness or propaganda
Marques will influence the Tesla stock price after this video
I would argue and say it‚Äôs always going to be iconic. It‚Äôs like a MacBook Pro. You see one and go yeah that‚Äôs a MacBook. People may not be surprised to see it but they still distinguish it from every other laptop and respect its design.
I wish it was 10% smaller for the rest of the world
just ask souhh characters. too many vieos on car. go to space with niel and chuck. drop that
that intro tho üëèüèæüëèüèæ
I don't think steer by wire was first by Tesla
Styling wishlist for the next gen: flared rear fender.
I do not care about panel gaps.  As long as the vehicle moves I am happy
I have seen doorstops before. Iconic? Pffft.
How long do the tires last?
if you take this cybertruck to an extremely rural city they gonna think theyre making another back to the future movie
My stainless steel appliances in Hawaii need regular mineral treatment or rust spots
"i got tired of EV,S ,PLUGING IN AND OUT, THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS SOAL IS THE IPACE"
Just a heads up the Lexus RZ has done steer by wire system
"Everyone mentions what they've done for when it's freezing cold opening the door, but what about when it middle of summer in high heat areas? Will  it keep cool in the areas where you will be touching to open the door?"
I love it I can‚Äôt wait to have one people come up to you talk about the car because your mkbhd the best tech reviewer on the planet
99% on line hate it.  99% IRL love it.
This thing is amazing.  Social media üêë are the only haters
I think MKBHD should be the NEXT host on Jeopardy...
So much revolutionary tech.  Even installing the battery with seats and console is revolutionary.  Installing from bottom of the car saves time building.  Saves money.  Tesla makes 30% profits on the other vehicles. Model Y already best selling car worldwide gas or electric.  Their factories build vehicles faster than any other factory.  Musk wants to be USA largest battery producer.  Right now Chinese CATL largest battery producer
"–õ–∞–π–∫ –∑–∞ —Ç–æ, –®–û –°–¢–ê–†–ê–õ–°–Ø"
26:11 The Hummer?
Wonder what's the average city/ highway speed limit is? Being fast really doesn't matter unless you're going to be at a closed track. Who tracks a truck?
13:55 Just Marques giving a video editing masterclass in the middle of a car review
"Stalk for signaling, highbeams, wipers, and buttons for hvac controls would be GREAT and are MUCH easier/accessible to operate. For turn signals, if you live in the city or certain areas, there are times when you are making a turn and immediately need to signal again for another turn. This is very difficult to do in the teslas when your steering wheel is turned. 
Tesla, PLEASE put physical buttons for commonly used functions(such as hvac).  Physical buttons for some stuff is MUCH better. Bring back the stalk for turn signals."
Whatta video- MKBHD flex to show us what he‚Äôs capable again üí™üèª
A Rivian is still seems like a much better deal. If you're going the electric truck route.
It's just a Pontiac Aztek
Cybertruck + rain + time = RUST!!! WASTE OF TIME
It looks like a 5 gradersesigned it
Comparing this to a PT cruiser should get you banned from doing any more car reviews
"The drag race is an important reason why EVs need a manual geared transmission, then us true car enthusiasts will happily join the EV evolution"
"I know I should comment on the content, but my gosh the audio in this video is exceptional. How is it so clean in that large warehouse?!???"
We CANNOT ignore the fact that the Tesla got the hit on the drag race (a head start) I can‚Äôt stop seeing it
"This is a $260,000 truck at 1/2 price"
Well done.
"I don't think I've seen a carmaker get so much positive press and get so many excuses for making such half-baked, unreliable, low-quality cars as Tesla. If any other carmaker (Toyota, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Ford) made cars that had just one of the many glaring issues as Teslas do, such as their ""self-driving"" stuff which is a joke, or that they intentionally lied about the battery range on their cars, or had panel gaps wider than Jupiter, those companies would be in the news for weeks or months, and their reputations would (rightly so) take a steep downturn. It amazes me Telsa has been able to get away with this."
I heard besides tire monitoring there is tire wear monitoring
Mercedes G Wagon - I think that is the peak modern-day blend of iconic (polarising) design but also a common sight. That's the category the Cybertruck is joining.
I must admit your delivery product knowledge is second to none a true pleasure watching your videos
We went from non power steering to powered steering to variable ratio steering.  Why do we still have to turn the wheel 2-3 revolutions to turn vs just a quarter turn.  Planes flying by wire for decades.  48v system needed to steering electric motors as well as wiper motor.
"Come summer time, you will learn more about the effects heat has on stainless steel."
Great video again... just top notch...
"Mr. Brownlee as highly regarded as you are I still think that your script writing is underrated! All your commentary is incredibly engaging, measured, and well reasoned without any of the tawdry clickbait or disingenuous disparagement too often seen elsewhere.  Thanks!!!"
Tesla minimalism rules.
I have seen one parked downtown where i live and definitely slowed down and took a video. Made sure there was nobody behind me or around me though
"Would you share what city is that for not going there ever, it is soooo ugly."
"Nah, The EV6 is more iconic than this"
TBF the 911 Carrera T has a 1/4mile time of 12.2 @ 116 mph it would still get smoked by a cybertruck in a 1/4 mile race and the carrera cost 25K more
25:33 - why Pharell's has the tire covers?
"If you wanna talk archaic, we could bring up the fact that Henry Ford tried stainless steel almost a century ago, realized the issues with production and quality when trying to make a vehicle with it, and immediately pivoted back to the real stuff. It's a gimmick. It should not be driven on the road, there's a reason it's banned across the EU and the UK. If you want to endanger others, have a shitty fingerprint covered mess, and love purchasing vehicles that miss pretty much every mark they originally advertised on, the Cybertruck is for you! It is a drivable affront to regulations in this country and that's quite possibly the biggest plus for weird Silicon Valley nerds with extra income just lying around. If that thing rear ends a sedan at high speeds, it's taking the whole top of the vehicle and the driver's head along with it."
I thought the rivian was amazing the first couple times I saw it. Now its like an F150 oh its there but nothing special. The cybertruck is going to be a bit diffrent for me because it sticks out more and I like it compared to the ford or rivian counterparts. If I see an f250 or nice gm truck I would look at it just as I was a few years ago. Its not a Pagini but its still awesome.
marques. the type of guy to review NOT ONE but TWO fridges.
So his video will now bankrupt Tesla as well? ü´£
"Is there anyone more fair to a review than this guy?  good bad, whatever, MKBHD just calls it like he see‚Äôs it and he owns one.  The main one.  Crazy.  Thanks for the video."
Most people watch cartoons not news
Pixelated car
I moved to Hawaii with my new 2017 Model X.  Most thought it was T for Toyota
"I like how objective you are always in the reviews, letting the audience take its own conclusions about the product. However, in the case of such a polarising vehicle I wonder: did you actually like the car? How does it feel? Do you recommend buying one? Those questions remain quite unclear for me after watching this review"
"Wearing a German T-shirt while explaining the race stats, subtle, subtle..."
Millions???
That intro was sick.
Good luck getting your insurance to pay for repairs
"Man, production value is getting soooo good on MKBHD videos, my god!"
"""No autopilot even if you paid for it"" What? Autopilot has been free for 10 years..."
Tell me that this is not a co-incidence üòÖ 10:15
PT cruisers were terrible from day 1.
elon really out did him self with this one
MKBHD is such a Tesla sucker!
The front looks bad ass
Those first few front 3/4 shots are Hollywood level... ::chefs kiss::
Hands down your best intro ever.
"Race was against a standard 911, not a modified Turbo S"
The intro.....THE INTRO!!!!!!!!!
Tesla was generations ahead with their other vehicles.  Legacy auto with their 8-12 generation cars did not offer the tech like a first generation Tesla.  Tesla checks so many boxes right out of the gate with first generation vehicles  Big 3 only knows retro and afraid to step out of the box.  Tesla is definitely revolutionary.  What will a 8-12 generation Tesla look like!  Made in America  USA leads European auto finally!!!üá∫üá∏
"Like always, honoring to the HD on your name! ü¶æü¶æ"
I know that MKBHD has been saying for a long time he doesn‚Äôt care about panel gaps. I accept that for him. But I must note it unexpected given he seemingly cares about the small details in almost everything else.
"Bro missed the chance to use the ""invincible"" introüëÄüåö"
Seems about as useful as a truck as a Honda Ridgeline. Still looks like it was slapped together in a garage.
i saw one yesterday on the road. the cybertruck didnt look real
is that your son?
"I hate cars, that's why I love the design of Cybertruck lol"
"tbh, i like the cybertruck design. not because i find it pretty, but because it's bold. we need more of that."
"ah yes, the Incel Camino"
Not Marques drving through the hood lol
That refrigerator is anything but iconic üòÖ
Serious F1 vives at 14:00 üî•üî•üî•
‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not stock‚Äù
Start of the video üì∏üî•üî•üî•
Man the paycheck he got from this is insane.
Ok free marketing. I am your target demographic.
"Damnnnnn, 14:00 changed everythingüî•üî•üî•"
MKB is evolving
The are other mass produced products that are iconic. Example: iMac G4.
I can't imagine driving a cybertruck in jersey city.
"What?! How can you say ""150k is way over""?!! Every price I'm seeing online for *used* models, are all, at the very least, 160k and above. 
Maybe the market shifted in the couple hours since you released the video? I don't know. Either way, this thing ain't worth it by a *lot*."
"I like the usual MKBHD videos but they're as misleading as the marketing they're mentioning. Significant manufacturing defects on 100k+ products being talked about as quirks, and then calling Tesla's video versus the 911 as anything other than ""misleading"" is just as bad. Nobody is saying that being ahead at the 1/8th mile isn't impressive, but Marques saying that misleading marketing is fine and doesn't matter means that no review he ever makes can be trusted to be honest and accurate."
That shit is nowhere near iconic üíÄüíÄ
A Ford Raptor looks the same as other trucks.  The Cybertruck is a Lamborghini of trucks with its chiseled looks like a Countach
"When I first saw the Cyber Truck, it reminded me of two vehicles of the past.  One is the Landmaster Vehicle from the movie Damnation Alley and the Delorian."
I truly enjoy your reviews. Great work
K turns
"There will always be haters for new things, I absolutely love it, and I am just glad it exists with this many innovations."
New rivian next?
Oh man! I wanted a pt cruiser so bad when I was in high schoolüòÖ. I totally forgot about that car.
Best video I've ever seen on your channel!
CYBERTRUCK IS  JUST TRUSH . ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§¢üóë
"I think the fact that the rust issues and the fact that the stainless steel is hell to clean (more than just fingerprints) is criminal. Seriously, Marques?"
11:45 63% admit ‚Ä¶ meaning 37% don‚Äôt; we see the number again‚Ä¶number 37 veritasium
I think this guy should start a channel reviewing smartphones
I want to thank you for being what I sadly think is just too few people that can succinctly express themselves in proper English. Please continue with your good and uplifting work.
saw one in person today. looks horrible. plus it was already rusting.
"just wanna say, as a fellow new jerseyian (not sure how this relates), the anamorphic lenses look nice! I'm sure they cost a fortune :0"
"Marques, I think Toyota was the first one to implement Steer By Wire in a car, in their Lexus RZ450e."
It's def a PT.
"god you shoot stunning videos, content was amazing yet the visuals were just next level"
You were right! Best video ever
I didn't know he had a modded 911.
"After watching this video, another 6% of truck drivers stopped toeing vehicles with their trucks.

Small price to pay for salvation"
"No, I won't buy _any_ spaceships from stupid Musk‚Ä¶

UPDATE 18:47: Ha! Do you know what I meant?!!!"
"The negatives you mention in the intro seem pretty bad. I feel like you didn't emphasise that enough if those are all issues with the car lol.

You also mentioned the bullet-proof factor meaning you'll be fine in an accident. But does that mean there are also less crumple zones? Wouldn't that be more dangerous for the driver?"
My OCD could never live with the hand and fingerprints!
"It‚Äôs not iconic, it looks like a door chock. Musk feasts on people who are trying to beat the neighbors or as most people say- keeping up with the Jones."
No interior riview ?
Bro gets 2 trucks and wont shoot the business one lmao. Comonnnnn bro üòé
So right at the end.  When you see like 10 of these in a row they are going to get old real fast.
"9:59 I'm surprised the body is legal from a crash compatibility standpoint, less crumple means more energy transferred into the driver and other cars"
Great video I think best case scenario it goes from ‚Äòunobtanium‚Äô to ‚Äòrecalled‚Äô so I‚Äôm never in a position to be mowed down by one
"Tesla cybertruck was not the first production car to have steer by wire. I know that the 2023 Lexus RZ 450 has steer by wire. 

YouTube channel Engineering Explained has a great video about it, and explained how it could fix Teslas yoke problem over a year ago."
"Hot take.  It doesn't matter, big expensive EV trucks have already been done.  Most reviewers seem to think the Rivian is better anyway.

The entry level EV market is what needs attention.  Tesla is handing BYD the future."
You are so good.
"""If someone hits you, you'll be fine"" Cmon man, I know you understand concept of energy transfer and crumple zones. This is basically going back tot he steel body cars from the 50s."
"It sort of looks like a low-res Aztek. Seems like the door was ""Boeing""-ed."
buttons inside the glove box or away from sight when the screen goes out would be very cyberpunk cool water
That thing is so ugly.
and Tesla makes the batteries that go into the cybertruck. 4680 cyber cell.
"How many orders have been canceled? When the first day they announced, cyber truck much better than now, the price, the range and much more."
The nose going up and down is ‚Äúpitch.‚Äù ‚ÄúYaw‚Äù is rotating left and right.
Are they going to put steer by wire and rear wheel steering in other Teslas?
Mini cooper? It‚Äôs pretty iconic but you see them quite often.
Definitely Iconic.
Iconic for being bad yes.
"Quite the milquetoast ""review"". Couldn't even properly call out Tesla for legally lying in their advertisements; I wouldn't call misleading potential customers as ""clever"". Hardly went over any aspects of the truck apart from brochure bullet points. How about the interior space or things like the front lights don't work all the time in snow because it builds up in the gap between the bumper and frunk. I know some of those things were mentioned in other videos on AutoFocus, but this is supposed to be the main review where you bring all that stuff together into one cohesive and comprehensive conclusion. The conclusion we got here was philosophizing about if the truck iconic... Disappointing, I expect more from this channel. The production value was nice, but that's about it. Style over substance"
Excellent review!
already a pile of scrap metal
Gold lens flairs!!!! üòÆ
longform content undertated but this just goes to show quality > quantity make more of this good to see the old days back nothing on tv is good now only youTube save us please from detrimental media.
"I think most people who hate it probably don't express that, and most people who love it probably do."
The biker: ‚Äúif I get hit by one of those I‚Äôm definitely dead‚Äù üëéüèº
Much better quality üòÇ yeah sure new teslas still have issues from the old
2:30 so you mean Americans won't try to steal it? Thats pretty shocking.
9:05 incorrect torque?? Why didn‚Äôt they just use blue loc tite???
How many videos can be made on the same vehicle ? ü•±
The wiper doesn't wipe the whole windscreen
"If this comment gets 100k likes, perhaps Marques will be kind enough to get me one? Worth a try."
"The PT cruiser is not the Cybertruck for sure. The PT cruiser got TONS of attention on a hot rod throw back design, and people loved the idea...and then when produced it had the most anemic drive train, the concept car also looked a bit ""meaner"" and had fat tires leading people to assume V8 and not a 4 banger. The ""Prowler"" suffered the same fate. I remember people taking about it, people were saying how crazy it was that it HAD to come with a supercharged V8 etc etc and then the production car was released and it had a 200hp V6...."
Haha love it.  cybertruck = pt cruiser
What an intro! ü§Ø
Some hero needs to wrap a cybertruck in the Gmod missing texture texture.
"I like your videos 
Pin me pls"
"This has to be one of your best videos, shoutout to the entire crew, the editors, camera men and miles too this was one hell of a video!"
"It‚Äôs no Rezvani build wise or Porsche speed wise, but when I think of ‚ÄúThe Future‚Äù‚Ä¶.this is what I imagine."
It's a napkin design. Looks cool though
delorean is also iconic and a piece of crap too
"Americans going green- building trucks wider and bigger and heavier.
It's like you guys are huffing paint between meals."
When i saw Pharrell Williams with one i was like he bought just for hype nothing else same like kim k
sponsored!!
visual pollution
shout-out to Miles
so we are going to get a cyber truck face lift?
"Poor Quality Control loose door latch.  No big deal, just bring it in.  5 minute fix.  Just don‚Äôt lean on the door when you‚Äôre going down the highway because the latch might fall off and then you‚Äôre hanging out of your truck like an action movie hero."
"That was no base 911, and that is not the model that Tesla raced. Wait. You also said your 911 Turbo S is not stock?"
"Overrated, but good video ‚ù§"
What about crumple zones?
I remember the PT Loser I loved that car lmao
No.. its not stock.
Speed sensitive steering has been out for decades. Even my 94 Acura has it.
Love the fact you raced it against your own TT! It‚Äôs not so much iconic as an original oddity
I‚Äôm going to be either high on meth or cocaine to buy this box
I went from hating it to really liking it tbh
This has got to be your best review you guys have ever made! Well done!
Why do you have 2 cybertruck?
"You owned a Plaid which pulls until the end and beats a Porsche Turbo S in a half mile. 
The Plaid is faster not just way quicker. Stoplight to stoplight the CT is quicker than a Turbo S."
"No. The most dangerous thing about it is the height of the hood which guarantees more pedestrian deaths than other vehicles. 

People acting silly about a big dumb, useless trick will lessen over time. The poor shape will always be a factor."
Shout out to the editor on the intro of this video! üî• the MKBHD in the cyber truck was a very nice touch
"Dude, this video is iconic. I didn't think I'd watch an entire video breaking down the irl Halo warthog but here I am ü§£"
"Rocking the Germany jersey, looks good"
"If you've never owned a pickup,  you really cannot speak to its usefulness as a pickup.  It has no real faults as a pickup,  including towing,  because not only is towing rare,  but so is towing full weight at great distance."
Anyone have Cybertruck dreams?
I'd rather keep my fingers thanks
Wow. Definitely your best and coolest video. That intro was incredible
Nope
"I'm I the only one that notice the ""AF"" - Autofocus Number plate.....
Marques, u did all, I really appreciate üôèüèª"
Just want to give a shout out to the graphic designer that created the review intro...my goodness.
It's the emperor has no clothes car.
I mean ‚Ä¶ a pinto is pretty iconic.
I can see the door has a slightly darker color than the panels beside it despite they're at the same angle. What visual trick is this?
"Just need some duck tape to fix the$100k truck door. They should be paying you for doing their beta testing. No, wait. You paid $20,000 extra for that privilege."
N64 car
The future is here!!! Elon you did it again!
so how much does it cost?
"Excellent review, love the Cybertruck."
I'm only here for the German Frisbee Shirt!
The ford bronco was a crazy car when the new version came out everyone would pull out there cameras to see the first bronco they have ever seen now they are everywhere
"It‚Äôs a useless beast of a thing that‚Äôs wrapped in an iconic cyber theme that will for better or worse make it a success.
Just try not to be the earlier (sorry sucker) adopter."
The did the car this way just because it is easier for the infotainment system to render the 3D animations nothing more
Dat moment when MKBHD call his car his child üòÑüòÅüëç
That looks like an unfinished product
mkbhd is doing drag races now? awesome.
"Putting the styling aside, the construction isn't that different to standard monocoque vehicles; it has a normal steel unibody underneath the stainless steel panels, although it uses aluminium castings front and rear, that bolt to the unibody. Those castings mount the suspension, which I don't like as aluminium fatigues with use, so I'd be expecting the castings to fracture at some point. Frankly, this is a dumb vehicle that only exists because Musk had a brain fart and had the coin to make it happen."
"Super cool video as always. One thing I REALLY disagree with though and that is dearly missing in my opinion, is talking about the crash behavior of a Cybertruck. You say you'll be fine in a fenderbender, but exactly the opposite is true. Yes, the car will be fine, but modern cars are designed to be destroyed in a crash, because that energy has to go SOMEWHERE. If it isn't the car, then it is your body.
Even though Tesla makes it seem like it's mostly about tech in new cars, they should still be good at getting you around safely. The cybertruck sadly fails at that (to my knowledge) and there are no plans to crash test it independently, which should definitely be mentioned"
"when I hear 'its a refrigerator on wheels'  
I hear
'its too expensive for me to buy, so I will talk about it like my dads buddies used to talk about Beemer owners in the 80s'"
just had to flex that has got two. like he coulda just showed it from the back but no. lol
"This is indeed a J.J. Abrams level sci-fi video, in case am not the only one noticing the anamorphic lens flares?"
"That intro, though‚Ä¶ top tier"
How do you like the tonneau cover?
"Trying to sell a ""steer by wire"" solution as positive is just cheap. I've driven many of those cars by now, and obviously many more with a physical steering connection to the wheels. Not wanting to go into detail here, but you can feel the difference within the first seconds of driving. And honestly, I think most of these digital steering systems can be quite dangerous, because they are so unpredictably bad!  In my opinion nothing better than a steering wheel thats hardens at higher speeds by a physical connection, like in most high quality cars."
"I think this is the mindset of the person on the bike who gave you a üëéversus the people in the car whoüëç. As a person who walks around my town a lot, I have been hit by people in a car twice(luckily, they both were turning right at an intersection from a stop) and almost hit by cars tons of times. At the announcement of the Tesla truck, I thought the car looked fantastic, futuristic, and different from anything else, which made it cool. But as the reality of the situation sank in, a vehicle like that was going to be on the road, with its blinding shine and fully sharp metal design, was going to be on the road. All I could think of as someone who is a pedestrian, as someone who bikes, is that vehicle is a people killer. It‚Äôs designed to kill pedestrians, NOT on purpose; I don‚Äôt think the people who designed it want to kill pedestrians. But that‚Äôs essentially what that vehicle is. I think the biker was angry because, like me, he knew that, and the people in the car were still at the stage I was at the beginning, where I looked at the announcement of the cyber truck and thought it was awesome.

This is speculative based on my experience and thought process."
"Iconic gross, yes."
Porsche 911 is nice but I‚Äôm just disappointed he went back to ice
"The intro alone is enough reason for me to never want one..
Although i want one, i would hate the attention"
"Iconic, for Americans. The design is striking but the rest of the car is a let down."
"I was on vacation, and on the way there, I saw a trailer carrying 3 cybertrucks. My jaw dropped."
"You can put into the settings ""Fly to the Moon mode"" but do you think it will?"
"I don‚Äôt care if you like EV‚Äôs or not. I don‚Äôt care if you like Tesla or not. This thing doesn‚Äôt look like nothing else on the streets right now. And we need more initiatives like this in every single category, not just cars."
Iconically bad at being a truck? Yeah
It is crazy and like a movie prop and also hideous.
The most dangerous thing about it are its windows.
The camerawork on this video is absolutely incredible.
"being fastest from ""stop light to stop light"" is not hilarous, or fun when you passed by a cyclist,."
"Dude WTH is this intro, like it's always INSANE, every fcking time the intro is SO GOOD"
VW Beetle.
Bro raced his Porsche 911 against his own cybertruck. If that ain‚Äôt a flex idk what is üò≠
Iconic for all the wrong reasons
"Rear quarter panels and back are ugly - everything else is good. Still waiting on mine. üòÖ
You simplified truck use a bit too much. Utilization of the bed is a severe miss - folks who use their bed weekly will likely steer elsewhere. 
Thanks for calling Tesla out on the cost saving loss for consumers who want more."
truck in the back have different colour for door vs body 26:00
Only Elon Musk can like this comment.
I knew he would not have let anyone drive his Porsche. üòÇ
"13:20
I don't think that's fine. :(
Trucks are really inefficient unless used for tasks that simply require a truck, and even dangerous to drivers of lesser cars, even more so pedestrians and other smaller members of traffic."
Can't wait to see one sitting in a CarMax lot. üòÖüòÖ
"Couldn't disagree more on the fob. Phone app does everything a fob can and more. A fob is one more thing to lose, break and most of all one more  thing in my pocket. A fob would be a HUGE downgrade in my book."
"this was the first mkbhd I watched in 1.0x, great review!"
The intro was fire
"As a cyclist, I  am always concerned about the ability of drivers to see me on the road (bright clothing, flashing lights, etc). This thing would probably kill me at a 10mph collision."
It looks uglier from the inside.
"On the discussion of being ""Iconic"" the PT Cruiser comment is right on track.  Another example of this I have personal experience with is the VW Beetle.  Beetles were everywhere in the 1980s and again in the 2000-2010s (until they were discontinued for no reason...). Despite being everywhere, they were unique enough to get a reaction; I have owned two of them (2004 pattern and 2013 pattern) and my parents had several of the older versions, and you are constantly being noticed, and sometimes judged, for the car you drive.  That's what the Cybertruck feels like; people are going to judge you for driving one, and that phenomenon won't go away when there are thousands of them on the road."
Can you make a video on the new Asus Zenbook Duo?
it looks soooo bad
There's a difference between minimalism and cheaping out. Tesla owners are getting ripped off.
Those speed specs are actually ridiculous for a truck üòÇ
"""My child""üíÄ"
"See I get the ""new tech"" appeal but I feel a car, specially a truck should be reviewed as a vehicle and not an expensive tech gadget, specially overlooking how it was sold as a pickup truck but couldn't deliver half the promises"
I think it‚Äôs funny how the joy to hate ratio is flipped on the Internet comments versus real life reactions
"Seen a lot of CT reviews, but this was dope üî• Fun & informative- great work guys üëçüèº"
"It will go the way of the Mazda Miata, Avalanche and the newER Volkswagen Bug. The hype will die off once they become common place."
"I live in the Bay Area where these things are beginning to show themselves on the road. When driving, I stay TF AWAY from these vehicles and I don't want my car to be totaled.

These are absolutely frightening to drive next to with your standard Tesla driver behind the wheel."
"Hey, i felt that way back when i got my 2010 Camaro SS.  So many double takes!"
Wow..nice review dude!!!
the quality of this video is peak! love the CT
"7:38 no won't be fine. Your truck will be. But that impact has to go somewhere, normally it's the car body that crumbles keeping the occupants safe, now it's the people who will crumble keeping the truck body safe. 

Well i must say tesla made an Excellent design decision for a country with more cars than  people where cars have a lot more value than a person with broken spine. Great"
As a person who likes to be low profile. I could not see myself buying it. You'll get a ton of people looking at you as a Mark. Give. They'll believe you have money and secretly target you. If not purposely try to vandalize your vehicle. If not to get it it see if the hype if it being bullet proof is real. I'll pass. Being when I think of having a vehicle I think of having one I can take anywhere. In all environments and be safe or have a semi normal profile. That vehicle is way too high profile. Once enough of them is on the road then I'll feel comfortable driving one around. Being the Electric Hummer I feel has a regular profile. All people will see is a truck. Not knowing it's an EV or how much it costs. Speaking on the avg person not fixated on car models.
"The thing that people need to remember, as with so many other things... if you get attention on social media, it doesn't mean you're doing something good. People just think that taking a photo of what you're driving/wearing/saying/singing.... will generate some good content on their own social media. To mock it or praise it, it doesn't matter. Or even praise something they don't like, because it's good for traffic. The ugliest car and the nicest car in the world would have an equal amount of attention and people taking photos. That differentiation is gone, compared to the pre social media era. Same goes for people doing bad things or making mistakes. If you had an DUI or crashed into something or someone, you used to feel ashamed and only tell a few people. Now people go live instantly, trying to apologize or start vlogging their ""mental recovery to inspire others"". And drop links to their merchandize, of course.

People will  indeed stop next to your Cybertruck and go nuts... not because they extremely like the car, but because it's a celebrity car they saw on Youtube and see it first time in the flesh. It's a shame that this is now the new metric or currency, though."
"I think it looks good, but I'm to European to understand the hype tbh."
Everytime i see one driving i feel like im in a game
Can‚Äôt wait for the software update to make the Cybertruck quicker.
The Tesla shill returns.
It was called the Pronto cruiser
"Great video, but the product isn't desirable at all lol"
"Step outside of the LA area and you will see zero Cybertrucks. Not iconic, just a quirky truck for people who don't drive trucks."
dude review a g  class and talk about cars afterwards
Does anyone know what they used to shoot this video? There are some very clean and nice shot with kinda nice fringes here.
That intro is insane üî•
"As usual, objective and unbiased. Super job. Keep it up!"
13:55 the 911 reveal Marques ! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Yeah they're iconic. Iconically TERRIBLE! *laugh track*
I saw this thing on the street a few days ago. My online reaction was ‚ÄúDa Fuk? Why? This is some Elon Musk level BS. And apparently I was right.
My child üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Why do you guys think we banned this vehicle in Europe ? Because if you get hit by this metal fridge on wheels, you will basically get sliced in 2 pieces like a carrot. The whole line of this vehicle is a nightmare, not mentioning the light‚Äôs layouts."
I need to know how that steer by wire feels on rough ground and in snow and ice.
"Whatever this car is, it's not boring."
Why not just clear wrap it to prevent fingerprints?
What an amazing video with hands down everything I would want to know and learn about this iconic car! Amazing job Marques üëå
"FYI, if you ever happen to have a car crash while driving a Teska CyberTruck, you're going to die lmao because this car is not meant to protect you at all, it's meant to protect the car itself. All the impact of a crash happens inside the car."
"You keep repeating that this steer by wire feature is made by Tesla first (which has been debunked many times as wrong) while Japan has been doing it for too long maybe 2 years now in these Toyota and Lexus models. I don't know if it is an American thing to deny the world's innovation or it's just ignorance, but I believe it's very annoying."
The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck are phone reviewers trying to give Car Advice.
Bro this video was filmed so good
"Just yesterday I saw a Jeep Wrangler with a body kit mimicking the flat polyhedral volume of the cybertruck for its fender flares. That in itself is an interesting proof of this design becoming iconic. Personally, when it was introduced back in 2018 I found it hideous. It slowly grew in me to the point that I actually like it now."
Does everything well except long distance towing.
Really epic intro!! I also love how you compared traditional pickup designs to Cybertruck's.
Intro üî•
I find this car visibly boring. But I guess everyone else loves it.
Whats the outro song? Flo by molife. You are welcome
INTRO WAS CRINGE FAM
"LOL the ""cheapest"" 911 STARTS at $125,000"
How is this not part of The AutoFocus series?
"üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª great video Marques.
The prototype PT cruiser was very cool. The customer version that they sold was horrible."
Iconic 2024 -> Ironic 2025
"It's crazy that we are even comparing the speed of a truck to a sport's car. How fast the Cybertruck is, for a truck, is mind-blowing."
I love looking at the Cybertruck... I am glad I placed my order when it first cane out.
ugh another video on this
Editor deserves a raise just for the intro...loved it!
"This car is pretty mid. I see them in public, idk why people in the streets obsess over this car"
Ok waiting for MKBHD to pass Doug Demuro in viewership cause this is how I want my future car reviews epic editing and thought process ‚ú®
"Regarding the drag vs 911, that's false advertising.

 It's a 911T.  A manual 7 speed, a low entry and not the best of 911.
Also it's a 1/8 mile and not 1/4 mile, Because simply that 911T would beat the cyber truck and was catching to it even in the 1/8."
They just be throwing around iconic to children's drawings lmao c'mon
So BYD developed an 800V system but Tesla claimed to be theirs just for propaganda. They still buy their batteries from them no wonder they are beating them. Tesla failed to make mk2s not to even mentione they failed to even deliver already announced cars
"I saw 4 different Cybertrucks driving my kid to ballet in SoCal in 10 miles. Each one I saw, the door panels looks like it is different color than the rest of the body. Not sure why but It is not good. So lesson #1 of CT ownership, get it wrapped."
"Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt want one of those if it were a gift."
Pretty sure there's been a Lexus with steer-by-wire since a decent while back
Good to see Tesla continued to make cars without indicators.
"another superb video, hats off..."
Cool truck!
"This truck has potential. Its all stock but some after market race off road rims, Beefier tires and a nice wrap and it will head turning for sure."
This is maaad overrated. LOL
"@19:57 The Chevy S10 EV is only about 4,200 lbs"
The future has never looked so unfinished
did u buy one
Iconic review!!
6:49 the best part of this video
wasnt that one lexus the first one to do the steer by wire? RZ something?
"Fun how your final story says everything that needs to be said. The person on the bike, who would be killed if you hit them doesn't like it, and the people in a car which has crumplezones and are safe from your deathmachine think it looks cool."
Controversial =/= iconic btw
"that is one ridiculously ugly vehicle. I would not take it if someone gave it to me for free... well, unless I can sell it"
"The real dangerous thing about the cyber truck, is that it doesn't absorb energy from a crash. And all that energy goes into you injuring you (this was a problem with older cars, now cars crumble and absorb energy) The CyberTruck protects itself not you"
Tesla‚Äôs stocks should be popping right now
"lol nah the most dangerous thing is still the sharp edges, stainless bumper, blinding finish and poor visibility. This is some grade a Elon glazing"
"interesting point you made comparing it to the pt cruiser. the cybertruck looks amazing now but after we see it on the road for a while, or other manufacturers come up with similar design (inevitalble), it's gonna lose a lot of appeal. other brands will improve on cybertruck's faults and better cars will arrive, i guess the only thing that will keep cybertruck's value is only being the ""first"" at this kind of design, if that means something. great video marques!"
Well the hype will slowly disappear with time
"Unique car in a market where the user base behind it is perceived as cult and arrogant? What could go wrong? 

In all seriousness, just like a mustang driver, Tesla drivers and people who raise their trucks and widen the wheels, I feel that the biggest problem with the Cybertruck will be the reputation set by the drivers. Especially with influencers who will eventually get their hands on it and feel that they‚Äôre better than everyone. 

It‚Äôs only a matter of time before there‚Äôs some stigma/stereotype of Cybertruck drivers."
The novelty will go away after some time.
If i see a CyberTruck driving past. I'll definitely be one of those 80%.
I don't know if the people are reacting to the Red Camera they use to film üòÇ the Red Camera Rig is intense.
Super excited about the Ridge x MKBHD collab...üëÄ
What I like about Marcus's reviews is that they're always well thought out. I feel like he's sharing actual personal details of the driving experience.
"Xiaomi added very nice physical buttons to their first production car (Xiaomi SU7), and they attach magnetically, so touchscreen fanatics can remove them."
I saw one behind me in traffic today. Reinforced my position that I hate everything about it.
hurry up and let us buy it in AUStralia
Very interesting question you posed at the end. Only time will tell. I think it is other underrated features that will make it the best selling truck not the initial looks.
14:17 Yo it's Mark Brownley!
"Scifi looks is just about the perfect gimmick to launch into pickup trucks.   Pickup buyers were so brand loyal and anti-electric there wasn't much point trying to entice them with just another pickup.  The scifi attracts tech enthusiasm, efficiency fans and first movers. Of course it also turns off traditional truck buyers ...  The very people who were going to hate you anyway."
this video is really well done üëçüèº
"Cybertruck was Iconic from the second the first manufactured unit hit the road. The shape and the material alone are enough to guarantee that heads will turn and jaws will drop at the mere presence of the Cybertruck. The world beating technology contained within along with the handling, speed and sheer drivability of the vehicle make it a class of one. Period. There will come a day when Cybertrucks will be everywhere, just like iPhones are everywhere, it‚Äôs just a matter of time and that‚Äôs exactly the plan to make as common place as the VW Beetle."
as a biker i am more scared of this than a lot of other cars. so maybe because of that the thumbs down. (scadred as in i will probably die if they hit me)
Reviewing an electric car without mentioning the range. This is what you get when iPhone reviewers actually review important stuff.
"Thank you Marques for not doing the same sort of CT review that's become so common already.  I believe that the Cybertruck will influence car design going forward, and in that sense it's already iconic."
Nice porche
"This video's quality is on a different level. I wouldn't wanna be a tech youtuber at this time, because my competition would be the MKBHD..."
ugh it's the worst car i've ever seenüòÇ
"According to the survey, 37% of truck drivers tow stuff with their truck. There is the 37 again."
Nice video üî•
this video just shows why you‚Äôre the best at what you do
i'm surprised he didn't matte black this thing
Thank god we will never have to see this deathtrap in Europe because it doesn't meet safety standards
delorean of our times :)
"I don't understand why people think it's ugly or hate it because of the design. I purely LOVE it because of the design, everything else comes second. It looks so cool and unique."
quick vs fast... I think we have a work for that - acceleration
Imagine ignoring all the safety issues the vehicle has and still admiring it. That's both irresponsible and concerning. Paid and pathetic.
"27% of americans don't have internet, 44% of americans don't have internet with broadband over 1Mb/s. This is worse internet connectivity than most other countries in the world, so it makes sense most people dont know about the cybertruck even in the country of origin of the cybertruck"
Video games created this car years before Tesla did üòÇ
it looks like ironman car
You're not a car reviewer and you're not even on your AutoFocus channel yet you did the most perfect unbiased video anyone could do on this car.  Hats off to you‚ù§
Iconinc doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean good.
ITS NOT A PANEL GAP
Saw one here in the Portland area...i started laughing and only got a photo in my rearview mirror.
Forget Parking ON your block
I think think the cybertruck looks greatüåü
Somebody needs to make this but cool
From what i have heard the headlights are not good at all. Is it true?
The Tesla store next to my work just got a Cyber Truck for their showroom and it‚Äôs sick. The main thing when I went to go look at it is the fact that it‚Äôs a lot bigger in person than in videos. Like I know it‚Äôs a truck but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because the stainless steel or sharp corners but if felt huge.
It is ugly.  People are looking because it is so ridiculous
This was me when i first got my supra when it first came out
"Is it actually ugly? Yes. Yes, it is."
How is it legal to drive a vehicle without a registration plate?
"""Wow, that thing looks fucking dumb."" I don't know if that is iconic."
"I have no interest in watching a rich tech bro fawning over a rich tech bros idea of a cool car. you have a 911 for god sake, give it back if you think this thing is good looking."
Boring
"This one kinda watched like a video essay mixed with a documentary, in the best way possible. One of the best YouTube videos I've ever seen (still not a fan of the truck thoughüòÇ)."
The Lexus RZ 450e has steer-by-wire and has been on the road for a while now.
Really enjoy your videos but can't get past the fact you didn't mention the danger it offers for people if this car crashes. Such a sturdy car is horrible for anyone inside of it.
Where is the number plate ?
You have the best reviews.üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Sick truck. Love to see all the coping from people who hate it üòÇ
this makes me confused as to why popups were banned
Can @dbrand please make a sticker for the cybertruck?
I have to say it got me literally today took a video and everything but the cyber truck is small like my F150 was towering over it.
It‚Äôs good looking! It‚Äôs awesome!
"People should know what the Cybertruck is. End of story. This notion of people ""never having heard of it"" is just an observation about the state of people's awareness of the world around them today, I suppose. Pretty bad."
The Cybertruck is the Chuck Norris of cars
OMG! The Purple wheel are üî• I‚Äôm in love with that bike üòç
"The intro was so clean, Fantastic job"
I want one
Tesla's production is too slow.
"There's a reason the cyclist gave you a massive thumbs down. As someone who rides in manhattan, this truck would scare the living Sh*t out of me. If you get hit, your dead. That's true about a lot of trucks, but the lack of cushion on the cyber truck makes it extra lethal."
Highlight of the video 6:45 üòÇ
Wow this video production is incredible great work!
Buyers remorse on this will be huge once the fame of owning one wears off it will be at your local carmax at 50% off üòÖ
"I'm neutral towards Elon and Tesla but i think this truck is cool. It's fresh, it's brave, it's different, and even if you don't like the design it's good that they made it."
"Feel like we don't give enough credit to MKBHD, being able to give out such humble, honest, and true-to-heart review on lots of products."
Insane you shill for someone like Elon
There‚Äôs no way someone looks at that truck in person and dislikes it
Algo
More thought went into that intro than the Cybertruck.
Incredible video
It's a novelty thing. Plus it has unusual features. It will take few years for novelty to wear off.
"17:09 loool  ""my child"".  MKBHD is def a petrolhead üòÇüòÇ"
Well I think it looks just awesome!!! But let‚Äôs not argue about taste. When you say ‚Äûmost‚Äú of the people say it looks bad‚Ä¶ why is it the most preordered car ever then? That does not fit together.
"Boats at, a certain size are steered by wire. Or more to the point steer by wire and hydraulic. The cargo container ship that slammed in to the bridge was steered by wire and hydraulics. Steer by wire and hydraulic is great until they don't work and then you've got some real problems. What I'm thinking about is the wintertime when you get a lot of snow down there and it freezes. On the boat that doesn't happen much. But what could happen to a truck left outside for a couple of days? Just a thought!"
"I would think of the Cybertruck being iconic in the same way as the Volkswagen Beetle is iconic. It's going to be a car you see around, but it still sticks out."

"When I worked at Gulfstream on the G600s and G500s those are all fly by wire. It was only a matter of time before this sort of technology started bleeding over to the automotive industry.

Is it cool thing to see it finally happening. But it's going to be an absolute nightmare for the average individual to repair should anything ever go wrong. The way they have these things locked down is a huge concern in my eyes to anyone who wants to do self-repair."
MKBHD's Tesla Cybertruck Review: Already Iconic?
Looks like Marques was a little biased driving his new Porsche against the fastest truck that weighs twice as much üôÇ
cringe
Nice shirt! 15:15
"I'm disappointed you didn't talk about the safety at all. It doesn't ""crumple"" like any car. So when you get in an accident whatever you're hitting is definitely dead, and the person inside the truck will experience a lot of G forces increasing their chances of death. The automatic trunk close mechanism is powerful enough to cut off your fingers and won't stop.

You did talk about the quality a bit. But didn't mention that a lot of messages are already popping up about trucks starting to rust, which seems like relevant information"
"I think instead of the PT Cruiser, think more like the 1995 Dodge Ram Truck with that ""Semi"" look that the others copied that ended up as the monster front ends they have today.

And that's just the looks.

The Cybertruck has so many revolutionary features like...
48v
Steer-by-wire
Massive range in the suspension
Powered tonneau

Do you know what competitor is going to suffer as production increases?

Yes, some truck owners will get them, but the large SUV segment, the Suburbans & Expeditions bought by soccer moms who want to drive a beast because they think they are safer. And here the stainless steel is a plus.

What if Tesla is able to make a rear wheel drive Cybertruck for less than the Detroit 3 can make?"
If I were living in America I think the stainless steel would be beneficial...üî´üî´ü§£
"Elon = modern day John DeLorean, check him for drugs üßê"
It really does look like a prop car in a Science Fiction movie‚Ä¶ A really‚Ä¶ REALLY‚Ä¶ REALLY bad science fiction movie‚Ä¶ That ends up on DVD in the bargain bin at Walmart  ü´§
Pt cruiser was always a shit box ü§£
Comparing the Cybertruck to his own Porsche was the biggest flex ever üòÖ But also very informative
Musk must've won one hell of a bet convincing humans that an objectively ugly car is cool.
"""durable truck is useful"" Until you crash and it doesn't crumple very much. That is actually horrific for both the driver and anyone in or out of vehicle you are hitting."
Imagine that car is mine and driving it on Yemeni streets .. wow
"I think Cybertruck has enough oddity to perk people's interest, thus prompting a comment simply out of curiosity whether dumb or thoughtful.  Clever eye popping design but impractical truck in my opinion. Excellent video as always MR. MKBHD!"
"i like how you called teslas false advertising beating a 911 at the 1/4 mile ""clever"" and not ""straight up lie"".
Definitely changes how I take your reviews into consideration.

Bad look, Marques."
"Those people were stunned to see The Greatest Tech YouTuber That's Ever Lived, not the truck. I mean come on, that intro?? üò§ü§å"
"So, It is neither a truck or cyber.....what it really is a metal coffin. If you get in a serious accident in this metal box, the chances of you surviving is virtually Zero. There is a reason why we don't build cars out of stainless steel. Since the 1950s at least, automakers have understood that stiffer cars are more dangerous to people inside and outside the car because in a crash they deliver energy to other parties rather than absorbing it. In an early crash test experiments with more heavily built cars, collisions often did only minor damage to the car but turned the test dummies into paste. Since then, cars have been designed with progressively more sophisticated crumple zones to absorb impact forces. Musk‚Äôs boasts of a Cybertruck ‚Äúexoskeleton,‚Äù if true, are a recipe for gruesome carnage. It is hard to make curved shapes with stainless steel, so the truck both looks like a low-polygon video game asset from the PlayStation 1 and also has terrible aerodynamics. The large cab and goofy sloped back means the bed is so cramped it can‚Äôt even fit an ordinary bicycle.

we can conclude that the Cybertruck is just possibly the dumbest vehicle ever produced."
"I‚Äôd argue the Model T became iconic. And perhaps it was one in its heyday? I wonder if the cyber truck, slated to be mass produced, will be iconic in the same way the Model T was/became an icon."
that's the quality
"Aren‚Äôt cars supposed to get damaged in incidents? That means the material absorbs most of the kinetic energy, which means it doesn‚Äôt affect the driver as much - that should be a problem here right???"
wow this video was long and there was a lot of talking but my god marques has a way with words it didn‚Äôt feel like there was any fluff and I was engaged the whole time. Very nice. As usual.
"There are not millions of sales. There were millions of refundable reservations, many from countries that will never get one."
Can't _wait_ for them to ship the Cybertruck in EU. Pre-ordered on reveal day back in 2019. Not holding breath that the EU regulations will allow it ... definitely iconic.
It rusts and the viewing angles are trash. this will age like milk
The last shot is üî•üëéüèæüßëüèæ‚Äçü¶±üëçüèæ
Why is it yo child

ain't Cyberbeast's top speed supposed to be 135 mph? like they modified in Carwow's Vid?
How is emergency steering at highway speeds? like emergency obstacle avoidance?
The quality of the in car driving shot is  üî•
Iconic? Really dude? More like Iconic scam...you just wait and see people. Trusting Elons word or ideas is beyond laughable at this point. So much evidence of this guy making crap up and lying at every possible turn.  Go bakrupt and do the world a favor.. Elmo...üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"A rigid vehicle is dangerous to both the driver, and to the outsider. You crush the outsider, but then all the energy of the collision is now transferred to you and you get a broken spine"
Another great MKBHD video giving a great analysis on a product üèÜ
"Best car-truck Ive ever had!! I love it, its ridiculous, crazy cool, fun exotic and practical, Insane. I cant bealive its actually real!!! üéâ"
M K B H D in Cyberfont was a great way to set this tone.
4:49 Lexus has had steer-by-wire for more than 10 years and it's is a lot better too.
No bro. Just no.
Why is NO ONE comparing Cyber Truck to the DeLorean in their reviews. It's so freaking obvious.
"In places where they put rocks on the road to add traction for snowy conditions, imagine how pissed you're really going to be when that big windshield gets hit with a rock and you have to live with that crack in your view. Lots of engineering, minimum understanding of what they were designing imo. Also, and not to go against your feel, but I'm pretty certain the drive by wire was not engineered as safely as you would hope. If Tesla was an airplane manufacturer, they're probably closer to Boeing... way over-promising, way late to deliver, and coming up with BS in the meantime."
If that is your first truck I wanna fight you
Actually bulletproofing the cyber truck  is intentional as you know it‚Äôs first availability is in USA the GUN Country Capital of the world plus the current escalation of gun shooting in the country. So it‚Äôs more a safety feature for the family person who is in majority of buying this truck üòåüòåü´°üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Iconic for being the worst looking vehicle to ever have access to public roads
"People are definitely amazed at the truck, but more amazed that a young black male is driving it"
No.
1st within 100k views lol
"there is no legitimate debate whether the CYBERTRUCK is a good vehicle or not. its always either no, because Elon musk is bad, or no because electric vehicles are bad, etc. the price of the CYBERTRUCK could be increased 50% and people still would overestimate the cost of it. I argue with people about the price even though its on the Tesla website. blah blah blah, the cybertruck is great"
Cyber truck is not the first drive by wire nor is it the first with variable steering
Steer by wire has been a thing for over a decade...
"4:50 The Lexus RZ 450e was the first car to ship steer by wire, amazing car, glad to see its being picked up by Tesla as well. Toyota and Tesla can definitely make it commonplace."
I wonder how this car/truck gonna evolve over time!.. will it keep this iconic design or it will get curvy or gets new design... idk time will tell.
Holy shit whose gonna win the race
You can bet there will be lawsuits once these things start killing people
"Is the Cybertruck Iconic because it is a Tesla product,or is it Iconic because it's a very ridiculous designed Pick up truck ü§î"
"This is definitely the best video your team has ever made! The graphics, storyline, shots, and just everything was superb. I've been watching your videos since 2016, so it's amazing to see how you and the team have evolved. Congrats Marques!"
11:39 number 37 really is everywhere...
the only iconic thing about it is that its won the ugliest car in existence trophy lol
13:21 They tried continuity but he changed his jacket between shots and zipped up
"The opposite reactions elicited from the cyclist vs car is somewhat emblematic of the worsening relationship between road users. To a person who predominantly drives - the Cybertruck is a fun, novel, and iconic product - while to vulnerable road users the truck represents a continuing trend favouring larger, taller, and faster, vehicles that disproportionately threaten the health and safety of cyclists, pedestrians, and even small car users."
I get the sense the most of the people who buy this truck buy it for the attention.
I couldn't imagine the amount of effort it took to make this very awesome review. You said this vehicle is insane well your level of production for this video was out of this world!
"I like your twist to doing car reviews  they feel more like a story that gets you interested rather than, oh, here's another car with xyz features! Keep em coming."
I couldn't imagine the amount of effort it took to make this very awesome review. You said this vehicle is insane well your level of production for this video was out of this world!
15:43 idk why I'm laughing at this
Best MKBHD review of the year.
"Gonna go out on a limb and say best MKBHD video I‚Äôve ever seen. Such polish, intelligent, incredibly topical (nice 2 cybertruck flex btw) and covered so much ground so succinctly. Well done man‚Ä¶."
The ones that trash the looks are the simple and basic types that are used to the same old stuff. The looks is what attracted me to ordering my Cybertruck because it is completely different from any other truck ever made
"I‚Äôd love to have the rear wheel steering in my Forester üòÇ

I‚Äôm curious, how much of extra cost it is to offer it as a package?"
"the thing looks cool but that‚Äôs it, the minimal panel gap and it kills the look in my opinion as well, I‚Äôd rather buy any other pretty car"
"This is a very brilliant video. I was informed, entertained and inspired. You‚Äôre really great at this"
This video is incredible
"This video is awesome, Marques. Shout out to his team."
I only want one if I can get it in gold and hot rod red because the face of it definitely looks like Iron Man‚Äôs helmet
If only they could make cheap bulletproof stainless steel sinks and other Stainless Steel vehicles with gentle curves.  ROFLMAO
Is literally a tiktok clout car
Dont touch my truck
The reason Tesla can do this is because they aren't part of an automotive cartel like the germans or Japanese
Can't wait for Elon to comment on this video now üòÖ
This comment section has to be the most hateful for a car desgin. üòÇ
You're being kind....what an awful vehicle!
make a video about the kawasaki full electric and hybrid naked bikes
"""My child"" got me good!"
stop reviewing cars they're not tech.
Not going to lie but the Lamborghini countach is the ugliest f****** car that is ever been made by humanity I will die on that hill
"""The most dangerous thing about the CyberTruck is the way it makes other people around you on the road behave..."" I agree!üèπüëçüòâ"
0:50 wtf
Looks like a DeLorean SUV. It's ugly as hell. And the world is full of ‚õèÔ∏è me's and wanting to be first getting something
‚ÄúMy child‚Äù ü§£ü§£
F'n YEAH!!! Way to show the race with your child!  Thank you.
"Why does it seem like you feel the need to hedge any praise of the cybertruck, makes you seem untrustworthy....its an amazing vehicle!!!!"
"Ill stick with my 4Runner, an actual real truck that will still be running like new after this CyberPOS has long been shredded and recycled."
Most people don't buy pickup trucks to do truck stuff. We call them mall crawlers here because people buy them to drive around in the burbs and look cool.
I don't care what anyone else thinks nor do i care about any snarky responses I might get to this comment; but that Cybertruck - it's f'in beautiful.  I can't think of any better word for it.  It's an absolute marvel.  I freaking love it.
"The Tesla Cybertruck is leaps and bounds different from any other car. For me that‚Äôs the biggest appeal. I want something new, deferent and unique. Even if it goes out of being iconic I‚Äôll still like it"
thank you i prefer my steering wheel connected
Lame vid.
The truck rendered using an original Playstation.
Iconically awful
"Great. Millions of overly fast, heavy murder machines without crumple zones barreling down the roads driving by man childs that don't know how one should drive a car. I'm glad I'm European and never have to deal with these cars in the wild. Because they are very much illegal here as it should be üò∂"
Best MKBHD video I've ever seen!
"I wonder what the crash safety is? Can't be much of a ""crumple zone"". On top of that, I feel like hitting another car would be more akin to hitting it with a weapon than another car. I would not want to get into a crash with one of these in my honda civic. But that is just a feeling"
Imagine how good it could have been if it was more usable for the size of it.
Damn this video was incredible!
Why did I think he was about to pull out the pow pow
Comment section is full of trolls who vent from crappy life lol so don‚Äôt even pay attention.
This was a great review. So well written and paced.
Honestly some DEI could have prevented this unseasoned truck.
23:50 I think you got that thumbs down because that truck would literally kill that biker if it hit them. It's nothing but sharp edges.
This Review : Overrated or Underrated !
"Ok, so the CT sucking for truck things ""is not a reason not to buy it because people don't use them for truck things"""
I'm rating this review a 10/10 ‚ù§‚Äçüî•‚ù§‚Äçüî•
Ive always liked the LOOK of the cybertruck. I mostly dont like the elon musk of the cybertruck.
One of the best comprehensive vids on this truck.
Cant wait for the porsch review
It‚Äôs stupid
"I ordered one back in 2019 when it was released.  I had high hopes.  The production model is overpriced garbage.  Tesla dropped the exoskeleton design and nerfed the rest of the design by skimping on the thickness of the stainless steel and other massive compromises such as shrinking it.  Then they doubled the price.  The people who bought this car initially were futurists.  The people buying the nerfed mini version are just attention seeking douchebags.  It was an easy choice for me to cancel my order.  A futuristic amazing vehicle reduced to a mass market fashion accessory for the ""look at me"" crowd.  No thanks.  The production model is ugly wavy refrigerator grade stainless steel and looks awkward due to the resizing.  Most of them are rusting already and the bed is not even water tight.  It's amazing that Tesla could screw up so badly.  Once the hype runs out on this vehicle like it has already with the Model 3 people will start dumping them.  The model 3 was selling for more used than it was new during the pandemic and now they are at least 1/2 off due to the hype dying.  When the public tires of looking at these rusty things values will plummet."
Tesla owners in a cyber truck I'm in bindableeeeeeeeeeeee!!üòÉ I'm stuck üòï
Nice to see an old Formula 1 tech in a production car - dynamic steering ratio
"I feel like this is just history repeating itself. People had similar reactions to the Hummer H1 when it first came out. Few had it, many were surprised by it and either wanted one but couldn‚Äôt afford it or flat out hated it."
"I live in California and I've seen a good handful of these around (my count is 7. maybe I've seen the same truck twice but I saw at least 3 unique ones). you know where I've never seen one? home depot. which is where I work and I see tons of f-150s, Silverados, Tacoma's, ridgelines, even rivians and mach e and that small truck ford makes, but currently nobody who's bought and been given this brand new truck seems to be using it for work. at least in the south bay."
Wish you guys did an overhead shot of the turning radius compared to some other trucks. Great vid
Refrigerator-on-wheels is a good one ü§£
My only surprise is that Marques hasn‚Äôt wrapped his yet.
"No people getting giant trucks for only basic daily tasks isn't fine. Big cars are the reason we have to build bigger parking spaces, bigger roads and because other people feel less safe in ""normal"" cars, they get these behimiths as well for as you said: no real point. It's cool that Tesla is going into the gaint truck market and try to electrify it. But they're goal, if they really care about the planet, they should try to get people into smaller cars not bigger ones..."
"Man, you're a really good presenter. Great video!"
"There are many things I might buy. At the end of 2020, I sold my old 59‚Äô Nordharvn trawler.  I bought a 63‚Äô Nordharvn trawler which is a massive pain in the ass. But I can think of two things I will never buy Cyber Truck and the Vision Pro from Apple. I don't wanna wear something goofy on my head. And I don't wanna drive around in a tank."
The quality here is just so insane. This feels higher quality than most of what I watch on TV. Blows me away that we‚Äôve been getting this kind of content for free for half my life.
The ‚Äúhand over hand steering‚Äù comment about an f150 makes me feel like you don‚Äôt ever drive real trucks
"The elephant in the room is that this is a killing machine that people are buying just for laughs... There is no space for pedestrians and cyclists in America, and soon no space for small cars that will just be smashed by this metal machine in a car accident."
Hmm i dunno..  I wouldn‚Äôt consider it iconic until more people get their hands on it.
Is the CyberTruck charging faster with the range extender?? We all know you've had it for 2 weeks.
"*first ones to do it on large scale production, Lexus came out with a Japan only car with Steer by wire 5:47"
I don't think I could own one due to the fact that people will come up to me and I am an introvert!
"That 911 ad is just genius marketing. When you have reviews of the Cybertruck  with a WHOLE section dedicated to comparing it to a 2 door sports car and why its ‚Äúactually‚Äù slightly faster, you know they‚Äôve already won üòÇ."
While I appreciated ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be fine‚Äù in an accident what happens to other vehicles?
Lol. Nobody behaves like that in Vegas when they see a fridge on Wheels.
Get out of the passing lane!
"iconic is not the right word. infamous. silly. absurd. 

It's a thing that exists, but it also screams, ""I'm A GIANT DOUCHEBAG!"" more than anything since  frosted tips."
One of the best Productions MKBHD has ever done üëèüëè
Ngtl Tesla is great
No. Why look at the center screen for the side mirrors and  then have to train your brain to look up for a BS mirror that isn‚Äôt a mirror but a wasted monitor? You need a mirror for the interior cabin. I thought this was a trick channel?üòÇ
"You went kinda soft on this review. Disappointment you didn't really talk about safety since the thing is a rolling death trap for everyone else and maybe the driver since they haven't done crash testing on it yet. 

If you want a more fair and realistic review, check out Throttle Houses review"
"It's definitely iconic ""now"".  Question is will it still be ""cool"" after 5 yrs."
I'm glad you spoke about towing and offroading. I'm so tired of seeing Cybertruck towing vs xyz or off road vs abc. Many are probably like me who never sat in a pickup or drove one before. Cybertruck is a different class of vehicle. It's a large stainless hard freakin steel sedan that is the safest in the world. I would love to see Cybertruck collision vs other manufacturers go head to head and T-bone each other.
This guy reviewing vehicles' is such a joke
Cybertruck is the world's first S-tier celebrity.
I see a PT cruiser and I just think of a sport hurse.
That drag race part transition ü´£ü´†
Okay but one thing about the PT Cruiser is that in marketing materials it looked AWESOME and GIANT but than IRL it looked like.. well how it actually looked‚Ä¶
Just such an ugly vehicle!
You can say whatever you want... it is FUGLY
It's over hyped. Other things regular car
26:13 that just means ill wait till they depreciate to buy one.
"Also, if it‚Äôs currently at its iPhone 1 stage, what is it going to look like at the iPhone 16 stage?"
"Hahaha, based on the vinyl and the location, just the other day I saw that truck that went off the road and had to be saved! üòÇ"
The production of the video is amazing i guess this is why he‚Äôs the best the transition from the tesla to the Porsche couldn‚Äôt even tell they were at a race track & aerial shot üëåüëå
"its a really REALLY fugly car. you cant change my mind on it. you can put whatever top tier tech in it, its horrible. whoever actually feels like they must have that vehicle...there's something wrong with you"
I'm the first in Germany to get it!‚úåÔ∏è
It's disappointing that they lie about the speed just to look good. Reminds me of a certain former president.
"""the most ex-girlfriend motor vehicle ever made"". who would've thought musk would need this."
Do you actually use a truck? The side reachability is stupid. That's the reason for half of the 90‚Ä¢ degree angles when comparing the side profile
I agree. Took delivery last week and people driving up so fast to take photos and pull out their phones or just pull to the side is out right dangerous.
"This is video review is WAY much better than the Doug Demuro video which made me fall asleep. 
The quality, video and audio quality, it shows that the budget behind the work behind this video. Truly shows. 

Kudos! More like this please."
0:52 jeeez chill out üòÇ
The VW beetle was iconic and sold millions. The CyberTruck will be like that.
‚ù§
Imagine needing a gender-affirming vehicle choice...
You are incorrect the first car with steer by wire is the Lexus RZ
What‚Äôs ct1?
It's iconic like Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES is iconic.  Unobtainable for awhile but launched a legend.  Cybertruck will evolve and get even better with each new design.
I thought Toyota made a steer by wired car first
ÿ®ÿ≥€åÿßÿ± ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿß
""
7:12 Jerry Rigg everything did a video on it shooting it with a bunch of different gunsüòÇ
It's hard to believe Chrysler sold over a million PT Cruisers.
Finally!
Always has been
"I just witnessed a Cyber truck pulling a 25-ft Airstream, from CA-TX."
Been in auto industry for 25 years and cybertruck is my favorite vehicle in that timeframe.
Today I saw a Cybertruck randomly when I was taking a turn
Miles Congrats.
This was a cinematic masterpiece
is BYD a good brand??
The fact that people in the USA drive trucks as regular cars is frightening...
biker's fault
"It's either going to be the funny big car on the road that struggles in easy truck situations, our viewed as the stylish modern status symbol truck, despite not being luxury or more expensive."
"It‚Äôs amazing that the absolute first thing everyone does now, whenever they see something different, is immediately get their phone out to take a photo/video. To what end; to prove they saw it? To look back on it themselves? To show as many other people as possible? They put more effort into recording the moment than actually experiencing the moment. It‚Äôs a sad state of affairs."
Hydrogen > Electric.
Really love it‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"The first generation Prius probably had a similar arc. Celebrities used them, then eventually the average person did."
"Whenever you have the opportunity to get half the utility for double the price, you must jump on it."
"Its iconic, but more iconic in the sense of something like a fiat multipla."
I am waiting for the solar roof option so that when the power goes down I can charge the truck to get to places without range fears.
"An iconic, metallic, angular design that's then mass produced and commoditized. Reminds me of the Motorola RAZR."
I like it but I feel like the conclusion should like so i think it‚Äôs good or I think that if you want to get one it‚Äôs not a peice of crap just monologueing at the end isn‚Äôt the way imo
PT cruisers? Volkswagen beetle is a better comparison to an iconic design. The beetle was eventually the best selling car for decades. Cybertruck will be the best selling vehicle in the near future.
I won‚Äôt lie this is one of the first videos I have seen from you where you clearly dance around certain topics barely touching them then others going all in on. Confirmation bias or advertising idk but either way it‚Äôs not good!
"Every big youtuber is pumping out videos on this trunk cause they need ""YOU"" to pay for it.

Don't get caught up in the hype or nonsense they just need ya to fund these vehicles once it's paid off they'll move on"
I'm in the video!!! Lmfao I didn't know that was you in the Cybertruck üò© I just thought it was some celebrity or Tesla worker driving it around. I didn't know you were in Kearny. I thought you were in California like all the big YTers.
Glass top on the back is too low.
It always astonishes me how big American cars are...
Tesla=Overrated
"I feel I should watch this at a movie theater. Insane production value. Might be your best one yet. 

That drag race section was insane."
Steer by wire is something Tesla should have done with the first yoke steering wheel otherwise it didnt made any sense...
Who has seen the cybertruck?
Can even one hater afford a Cybertruck?
That 15:03 drone shot is SO DOPEE
the most dangerous thing about the cybertruck is the lack of crumple on impacts
The production on this was next level man! Huge props to you and the whole team!
you‚Äôll be fine if someone hits you but not the other way around
1:49 there is indeed a very noticeable curve on the frontmost piece of stainless steel
Definitely not iconic. More like not seen as in never seen. I've only seen one in person and it was in California not in the state I live in. Definitely NOT iconic.
IIRC the standard range f150 lightning is lighter than the cybertruck!
The scene composition in the final part of the video is absolutely amazing
Holy crap that intro was cool :D
Think about the slug bug. It was also mass produced yet unique enough to be iconic.
This car is obese. Should be illegal to make non logistics vehicles this heavy.
Crappiest ‚Äútruck‚Äù ever produced. Nothing else needs to be said really.
Crazy Videoüî•üî•üî•
Next time get a Tesla test driver behind the wheel of the cyber truck before making these claims
Elon isn't going to like that you deadnamed ùïè ü§£
"Changing the steering ratio is going to cause accidents, but on the plus side virtually nobody is going to buy Elon's fever dream."
Shilling for the neo nazi? Good job.
"I finally saw my first cybertruck when I was driving thru Orlando last week, the size of that thing surprised me so much I actually laughed too much and swerved a little"
i must be a sandworm because it's driving me into a killing frenzy
i saw one on the road the other day. I didn‚Äôt like it when i first saw it‚Ä¶ but after seeing it compared to other cars on the roads. I now want one üò≠
Maybe I haven't been paying attention but when did the channel change names???
This just turned into a flex channel like linus but less subtle.
I know  a video is sponsored when  I see one
I dont like the mic audio. It sounds so empty
Unrendered De lorean wannabe capitalistic garbage
"""This thing really sucks at being a truck, but hardly anyone uses trucks to their fullest"" is the weirdest fan rational that I think I've every heard. lol"
"that wide shot from above was crazy. KEEP DOING WIDE ANGLE SHOTS 
pls"
"Not iconic, just hyped up."
The better comparison for the Cybertruck is to the Hummer H2.
"You have tesla stock, noted. Now go back to phones"
What a Gigachat review.
11:27 that percentage of drivers not using their trucks for towing is rather embarrassing
"It's iconic, but generally for bad reasons. You're always going to be seeing people shocked to see one because it looks so bad. And I'm not just talking about the inch wide panel gaps."
that was an absolutely amazing and honest and fair review. Thanks
VW bug is iconic; rareness is only one of many criteria for deciding a man-made thing is worthy of veneration.
Cyber 1................ 0üòä
Wrap the cyber truck matte black
The production quality in this video is insane.
Can you please wrap the cybertruck to matte black ?? It would look sooooo much better
Overrated
"Who cares about iconic when car is literally BETA, from software to physical execution."
These things are so fuggen goofy LMAO
"Let's say it correctly.
The Cybertruck beats every Porsche in a 1/8 mile race and at 1/4 mile, except for the 911 Turbo S that costs twice+."
The social bubbles on the web are real. Lots of people are locked into place by algo's. Some bubbles have no Tesla.
Steer by wire sounds wild to me
"if reactions are 80% positive in real life, 20% negative, then the internet is 99% trolls based on the comments.  ü§£"
21:00 pitch not yaw.....nose elevation is governed by the pitch axis.....yaw is not affected by the suspension as much as roll and pitch are
"26:25 ‚ÄúIconic‚Äù PT Cruiser. You are not old enough to remember the PT Cruiser, and you find the PT Cruiser to be a weird shape,but, in fact the PT Cruiser was an homage to iconic California Hot Rods and the shape was an instant recall for people a bit older than you.
Beach Boys: 409, Little Deuce Coupe. ZZ Top: Eliminator
Gene Winfield: 1933 Ford Model T,"
Iconic? No. Idiotic? Yes.
"I do not want a CyberTruck, I'm a Land Cruiser guy, but I do find it interesting."
"This was anything but a review. Well produced video showcasing some brochure points and some of the talking points on this truck, but glosses over or doesn‚Äôt go into most of the things a review would go in depth on. This is an opinion piece at best."
The biker knows how dangerous that truck is to them.
I see you driving past the Jersey City iHop!!
Put a sack on the back end
"I'm just gonna say it. Marques is the best YouTuber period.  From quality to script, to style to humor, etc etc. You might say... iconic ?"
What happens if it hits a pedestrian?
Ugliest car I‚Äôve ever seen. I hate the look of these new electric cars lately. They think they look futuristic but they actually just look like bad video game graphics from ps1.
Weighted hard plastic instead of steel?
"6:50 :p  Other YTer that totaly will, umm, one already has.  JerryRigEverything
11:50 Umm, Communting can be contractors going to/from work sites.
18:27 "" Shoutout to Engineering Explained, I'll leave the video below "", umm where?"
The cyclist prob gave you a thumbs down because it's another machine that will efficiently kill pedestrians and cyclists like the rest of the mall crawlers.
"Honestly Marques, I am extremely disappointed. This video doesn‚Äôt feel genuine and objective. No criticism, no mention of rust, downplaying other issues with the vehicle. In comparison to your Fisker review it is a joke really. I always appreciated the content you and your team produce for its fairness and objectivity. This however feels like you‚Äôre trying to make daddy Elon happy or at the very least not make him angry (because we all know he would be if you dared to even mention the word rust even once). I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels this way. 

How can I trust your other videos aren‚Äôt biased because of personal relations or dependence from the good will of other influential people?"
30min review and still dont know if you like it or not
The front door is very discolored compared to the rest of the truck. Almost like it's not the original door. I don't like that at all. Despite that I love the Cyber Truck.
Joy to disgust ratio lol. Love it!
"He calls the drive by wire underrated when this alone makes this thing completely undable to manouver in tight spots, specially when parking lol

Also that biker gave you the thumbs down because this thing is a killing machine to pedestrians dude"
You gotta love that Porsche 911 flex!! Congrats on the new car!
Hahaha yes! As soon as I saw the billboards I knew you were at Island Dragway. That's awesome that you brought both of your cars there to race them ü§ôüèªü§ôüèª
Amazing
"I sure hope the popularity of the Cybertruck pushes the automotive industry towards experimental designs, abandoning the current corporate design language most cars and SUVs have followed for the last decade or two. The Ioniq5 was a good start, hopefully other brands are already working on the next creative-functional, or retro-futuristic design or something."
"Probably against the law to make a rear-view mirror ""a digital screen""....you don't want to get in a wreck cuz your mirror didn't work...LOL."
"Excellent video MKBHD team. If not for the awful person Elon has become (and the insane price hike since being announced), I was hoping to get one of these later in its production run. I feel like this is the last time tech 'tubers are going to be able to dance around the elephant in the room that is Musk with future products."
afaik lexus did a steer-by-wire yoke in the rz before tesla did
Marques is the kind of guy to review the same truck in three different videos
imagine getting hit by this thing. This is some carmageddon shit
no curves and they manged to have panel gaps
"Any American truck on the road is not safe for people, I know, but I feel like Marques is lacking a lot of coverage in that aspect, from the super small turn lights to the weight and visibility. It should be talked about."
"rust? headlight blinding other drivers cuz it points upwards, and more other stuff for which you have to pay, the truck that has less storage space than a truck... cmoooon ü§£üòÇ not to mention gauges nowhere to be found unles you  look at the friggin middle placed tablet... üòÖ. I like the design, but that's all üòú. Not to mention Musk is a pathological liar who's lies negatively impact world economy..."
Best intro ever
Dodge had something called a Prowler ..i think.  That was a crazy design.
"talking about the stainless steel and not bringing up the lack of crumple points, visibility, or the fact that this is basically just a rolling deathtrap for those inside is a huge oversight and something marques absolutely knows about. If the car doesn't crumple, if that energy isn't dissipated throughout the body of the car, where does the energy go? Into the riders. We've designed cars like this for nearly a century.

Really concerned about his lack of criticism for the safety points in this vehicle tbh. that's the main complaint people have had about the cybertruck, we've seen how little the car crumples in accidents, and it's just irresponsible to pretend they don't exist."
"When the costs ""Eventually"" come down, Elon's Martian ambitions will suck up any additional income from the Cybertruck. I like, despite it's flaws. If only they had stuck with normal construction techniques and materials, it would have been here years ago, and might even be cheaper."
"You promoting dangerous vehicle for money and you should be ashamed. You can got money from many other sources but remain being a decent person, you know? Not cool."
This thing is like how intentionally bad design gets a lot of looks. People need to stare at the beast.
‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt download a car‚Äù .. checkmate anti-piracy ads
this video was exceptionally well done
"Five or six years ago while driving across the USA, we happened to see the OscarMayer Weinermobile driving east on I-80. And it was a LOT more interesting and a LOT more dignified than the Tesla Cybertruck. üòÑ"
"They may as well just paint ""douchebag"" on the side of this thing at the factory."
I just want an electric El Camino pls
25:19 It's funny because I had never seen a Bugatti in my life until one day I saw a dozen Bugatti Chirons and a Divo parked on the street in Pasadena CA.
"And again your argument about the towing being overrated cos 63% of truck owners don‚Äôt tow is also flawed. Cos most ppl who buy sneakers don‚Äôt want to get them dirty, but sneakers are for sports. Stop trying so hard to find fault and enjoy the innovation."
Looking forward for a new test of FSD
"The way I saw a cybertruck eariler this week on my afternoon walk in Columbia,SC. I had to stop and take a picture  because I was not expecting to see a cybertruck of all things in South Carolina this soon."
Thank you for bringing up how people are using trucks because trucks have crossed over into suvs for most people.
PT Cruiser was just a VERY BAD CAR! Never was Iconic. Not a good comparison.
"4:50 Tesla is not the first to ship a car with steer by wire, Lexus did it two years ago with the RZ"
"What an amazing review, just your opinion which is very authentic. You are very accurate in the understanding of what the product is and what Tesla is. Cheers from someone who is a very early shareholder and total car geek of all cars since 1991 üòé‚ù§ Amsterdam"
Tesla will always be in the main channel.
"the video production & the editing, ICONIC"
Porsche owners making Porsche like excuses for being beaten by a TRUCK
0:40 yeah these guys seem to be loving it üò≠üòÇüòÇ
"I love how the cybertruck doesn‚Äôt exist because it‚Äôs trying to reach a market, but simply exists because Elon just wants it too, and let the market figure it out"
I like it
"Owning a truck is like EV mileage.  Got to have a truck, just in case you need to move your furniture."
The intro graphic alone made me want one of these stupid things
Huh...I think you did broke a record?! Correct me if I'm wrong but from a Factory stock pickup truck.
Cyber truck is the new status symbol like the G63. There are many G63‚Äôs and that comes hand in hand with status and that‚Äôs the longevity of the cyber truck ü§ôüèº (great video üî•)
"I think it's too small, should be a bit longer and wider"
"MB, a question that so far no one has answered about the wired steering system. The system digitally adjusts movements according to the environment you are in, so in an emergency, for example a car brakes on a highway, you will swerve. Does this adjustment of the system not remove an important autonomous reaction that would be your muscle memory? Because if there is a constant, like a normal or even electric steering that doesn't adjust, you know how to calculate when you need to turn without losing control. Since you will never make this movement at high speed to ""learn"" how to turn without losing control, isn't that a safety disadvantage?"
I want this truck so I can use it to FORM VOLTRON !!
Elite intro
video paid by tesla every intelligent human know the tesla truck sucks
"With all the sharp edges,  i wonder how much the insurance is monthly."
Mexican cartel buys out Tesla‚Äôs entire stock
This will be the vehicle used as the Time Machine for Back to the Future 4 .
Not MKBHD trying to take Jason Cammisa‚Äôs series title from him üòÆ
"It‚Äôs unique , weird design yes but iconic hell no hhhhhhhh"
No it‚Äôs not stock goes hard
It‚Äôs Ironman face just crunched
Incredible üëèüèª
That cut at 10:05 of you driving between two semis is beautifully matched with the voice over. Thank you for that lovely attention to detail!
Imagine going on the highway... and seeing an unrendered car. üíÄ
This car is actually from 2024 30 years ago üòÇ
"In Tesla's video of the Cybertruck beating a 911, I think they used a base model 911, not a Turbo S. Although very impressive, I think Tesla should've given the Cybertruck the 1,020 hp Plaid powertrain rather than an 845 hp induction motor powertrain."
No‚Ä¶ your fan base doesn‚Äôt like Elon or the design. I know more people who think it‚Äôs badass than haters.
Isn‚Äôt the cyber truck illegal in the EU because those angles were too dangerous in the event of a crash?
"Iconic is a very kind way of putting it. Infamous or notorious feels more apt. Iconic implies the attention it gets is positive, when that is far from the case."
I'll take that Porsche 911 over a Tesla ANY DAY!
"I wonder if you own one here in the Philippines üáµüá≠, I am pretty sure that car owner will be invited in all car show events. üòÜ"
It's just a stupid car and you just making an advertisement for tesla
Still waiting on that 911 turbo s revisit
My man just dropped 27 minute videoüóø
Level of access journalism mentality and being a shill is really disgusting with mkbhd.
"Lexus RZ450e is drive by wire and a Infiniti Q50 from 10 years old was drive by wire, but only really new thing is both the Lexus and Cybertruck have no standard backup shaft to the front end."
Look up Adam Something's review of the Cybertruck. :D
this intro ATE!! even though we're fasting
"Amazingly thoughtful summation of the Cybertruck.  I love and I  would by a Tesla, but extreme minimalism keeps my wallet closed.  Still, they make the overall best E.V.....  for now.  Thanks for another great review."
"The cybertruck is a work of art, a masterpiece and drop dead gorgeous from any angle you look at it. Compared to anything else out there on the streets it makes everything look outdated, old and ugly. I have a Porsche 911 and the more I look at the cyber truck the uglier and more like a frog my Porsche starts to look. This truck is absolutely a true beauty."
"No being was hurt in making of the Cybertruck, but no guarantees after the launch üòÇ"
Cybertruck is more akin to the Iconic feel of the VW Beetle which never got old.
Attention Maxxing the car.
I think you should do a comparison video 1 year down the road...
Why do I feel like I've seen Marques review this thing at least twice already
I just hope the cybertruck raises the profit margins of Tesla over what the cars are making them and it doesn‚Äôt become their loss leader.
"The Model T and Beetle are both iconic and mass produced. Though I‚Äôd say this is closer to the Model T historically, I doubt the CyberTruck will be as equally ubiquitous as the T was in its era."
What really fascinating me is that everyone uses iPhone
It's an RC car that you can ride
"You didn't talk about the fact that, Tesla says the current performance of the Cyber truck is intentionally limited by Software."
SUch an amazing video
"Imagine spending $80,000 to $100,000 to downgrade your vic it most ways that matter üòÇ this vehicle is not made for car or truck enthusiasts. This vehicle is not made to be useful. It's not practical. So who is it for? The typical rich idiot who want's attention. Elon is a genius. And I mean that. He knew exactly what he was doing lol he build years of huge hype. But he knew that wasn't who would be able to buy this vehicle. So the common people never get to talk about how bad their experience was, and the people buying these, are just going to be flipping them. Bc in a lot of ways, these things are build like trash. Genius lol"
steering being dictated by software makes me uneasy üòÖ
That bird eye view of drag race was omg .best way to assess drag race
It‚Äôs so hideous lol
Iconic!
You the goat bro.... no debate. üéâ
Best video in terms of production quality that you've done! Excellent job!
It looks like it was designed in Roblox
Warum tr√§gt MKBHD ein Trikot des Deutschen Frisbeesport Verbandes?
I saw a cybertruck irl and just looked for a second then went on with my life
‚Ä¶where‚Äôs your microphone? Are using any plugin for AI voice reconstruction?
"I saw my first one in Fairbanks last week. It made my head turn, but overall looked like it just isnt using space properly or something, i dont know how to explain my thoughts lol"
This one feels like he wants back in Elmo‚Äôs graces
"Waiting for someone to figure out having 12v, covering the roof with antennas and installing ham radios."
Iconic in every negatively connotative sense imaginable maybe.
"It's like the iPhone. That first year, everyone kept staring at people who had one. Eventually, it wore off, and everyone had one."
63% of people not using truck bed is lower than i thought. There‚Äôs way TOO MANY trucks on the road from guys with huge egos
Man at 6:44 I was so expecting Marques to pull out a 9mm üòÇ
People on the street asked me if they could take a picture with my Model Y in 2020‚Ä¶. Look at it now. It will be the archetype of the Cybertruck - no need to reference the PT Cruiser.
Nice ad
It's kinda ugly but kinda badass at the same time. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"lol ""I'm not gonna test that ..."" hahahahaha 
I loved the TRON animation. I think it needs to be said here that the Cybertruck JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TESLA is an AWD vehicle NOT a 4WD."
"Imagine if Marques gave Apple as many ‚Äúbut no one is ever going to do that‚Äù or ‚Äú what about other‚Ä¶‚Äù excuses after naming and finding flaws.¬†
Either he has has higher expectations for Apple than Tesla or I guess MB really loves Elon. lol"
"I don't know your question's answer, I don't have any idea, is it overrated or underrated, I don't know. I can't even guess it."
The worst (and in some cases even dangerous if you are driving) trend in the current car industry for me is how many companies are putting all the car features into 1 or multiple screens (like climate control) where you have to click multiple times in order to see the option that you want/need for the sake of minimalism and futuristic looking interiors
MKBHD is really a Elon Fan boy ha.
‚Äúas the future unfolds the past will decay and fade away‚Äù Me
"that bicyclist gave you a thumbs down bwcause of what the car is, huge, heavy truck that will easily kill anyone it touches"
That cyclist maybe gave you a thumbs down because this car will be a pedestrians and bike killer. Those sharp corners and steel will left no survivors ahead or behind in a crash
@2:54 do you touch the entire driver‚Äôs door? Color is so different than the rest of the car
"I think Marques got a pretty bad launch. I would expect a 1.6s 60ft, tires were probably cold and maybe he didn't air down the tires."
I already know this is going to be the least offroaded offroad car and is going to be driven by influencers doing absolutely no work with it
Dude shot this video just a couple hours agoüòÇüòÇüòÇ
The bulletproof doesn‚Äôt qualify to be rated cos it wasn‚Äôt a deliberate feature. It just so happens the car is stainless steel and the composite of this stainless steel is able to stop some bullets. That‚Äôs it. Pls stop making look like Elon decided to make a bulletproof car
"That intro animation for the cybertruck has   to be one of your best, props to whoever made it!"
"24:17 Waiting for the cyber truck 2, it's going to perfect the flaws of the current cyber truck with improvements."
wait til Marques finds out about these F150s with whipple superchargers from factory running 1k HP
Silicon valley chad truck
Awesome content üëè üëå
Whether you like the cybertruck or not this video is phenomenal!
correct
The conclusion is that many people are really ignorant about the most important age of technological advances in our history. Except for constructor of the Pyramid üòâ  aliens n
Marques - are you going to wrap your truck?
Intro being straight up craycray
W car
"I'm not a Tesla fan (the opposite), but I don't think you need to be rare to be iconic. The 911 is not rare, but it's still iconic. The G-Wagen is iconic. The VW mini is (was) iconic. There is an element of being iconic which is about representing a moment in time, or in history. The Countach was as much about craziness & 80s excess as it was about being rare. It was like the epitome of the time. Is the Cybertruck the epitome of our time? I sure as hell hope not."
It's not a big deal...but I am going to make a 5-6 minute point about it üòÇ
bro saw the views on the other channel and decided to double cash it
Haters are going to hate.
It took you so long to say the beginning
Yea no‚Ä¶
i just hate the wiper being up like a flag
Looks like the door alignment is fixed ... hmm
Bro got fake mkbhd miles on set thats awesome!
Just noticed that Maques is wearing a German jersey. Greetings from Germany.
Are there haptics built into this video?! That‚Äôs a thing?
Nah. It's a bull$h!t design
Performance and charging will improve with future firmware updates
"Lots of iconic designs are mass produced and ubiquitous. Coca-Cola bottle, Helvetica font, Nike logo."
I looked out for this video because of the tweet. Just great take after great take after solid take. & this is why I continue to stay subbed and watch.
I believe a lot of the technology will make its way into their car
It‚Äôs still Homer Simpson‚Äôs car to me. I wonder how they will be able to be driven in Europe?
"10 year old me is screaming with joy that this exists!!
Aaand then there‚Äôs adult me, this will probably not age too wellüòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,only in terms of design might I add as this will very likely inspire similar design cues from other manufacturers !! Loved the videoüçªüçª"
"""So Elon Musk addressed this on Twitter"" 9:10 isn't supposed to be that funny"
I wont be surprised if this is the first mkbhd video people see
Ê≠£„Å´Cyber
"0:55 lol, what the heck is this introü§Ø"
"Apparently, everyone knows except for Elon...toughest truck. üòÜ"
First production car that was steer by wire was the 2013 Infiniti Q50.
MY FUTURE CAR
"0:43 oh, this is not our typical video"
The Intro was slappin ngl
"Back-to-back videos on Cybertruck!
Seems like someone is trying hard to sell."
"kinda like when the new corvette (C8) came out, it was really cool the first time i saw one. but as more and more people got their hands on one, it wore off. they arnt cool anymore"
‚ù§‚ù§
Million of people driving cyber truck? Touch some grass. We broke.
"for a sec I thought you were going to do a ""man on the street"" thing and interview people. the shots of random folks videoing is awesome. would love an ""on the street"" segment produced by your team. would be cool"
The cyber truck is just so satisfying to look at üòÖ
"It‚Äôs weird but that‚Äôs the good thing.  

Cuz it grabs ppl‚Äôs attention"
"People are not admiring the car, people just can't believe some are willing to spend their hard-earned money on that."
"This is the ugliest car I've ever seen, this is the death of automobile design. There are plenty of futuristic looking, electric cars that look good, this is not one of them."
Like if you‚Äôre here before 1 million views.
It's exactly how cars should have been in the first place
"Fucking sick intro

Edit: Never mind. Been watching Marques for a decade, the production on this is insane. Props to team MKBHD."
Congratulations on your most pandering car review yet!
Well maybe the biker gave thumbs down because getting smashed by cybertruck as pedestrian or biker is extremely lethal. That's why its banned in europe.
"I saw one of these for the first time about a month ago. Typically things look better when you see it in person. Not the Cyber truck!! If you don‚Äôt like it online, you won‚Äôt like it in person. I give Tesla credit for pushing the design envelope though!"
Hope this gets trending at #1üéâ
Great unbiased video!
lexus has had a steer by wire system for a few years now
"After seeing a cyber truck for the first time, I keep seeing them despite always traveling to different locations for work."
"I thought it was the lack of visibility that made it dangerous. 
There are some stainless steel cleaners that leave a residue behind that resist fingerprints. 
The most useful truck I've ever owned is a Subaru Baja with the extand-a-bed, trailer hitch and 4x8 light weight (1k lbs) trailer. I mostly tow my 14ft fishing boat.
A 48V power source will allow you use POE devices, like cameras with the correct adapter.
US law will not allow a car to be imported or sold without a physical hazard button. Expect everything else to be hidden in your infotainment system. 
I'll stick with my Baja, it is becoming a classic."
Why does the drivers side front door look darker than the rest?
"Yes, Tesla was the only automaker with enough balls and guts to release something so different from what‚Äôs considered normal"
"I genuinely thought he was going to review the IONIQ 6, I swear I can't read."
"Indeed probably your best video. For sure your most complete production. Only one thing missing, having both metric and imperial units everywhere not only in weight! 
Greetings from Greece!!"
easy downvote.
I had the Bugatti veyron ss poster on my wall when I was a kid ü•π
"I get it, but the pointy sharp edges, the weight, the speed, power and the size and the fact that it‚Äôll be the first truck of many people and will use it to go shopping is insane and dangerous af imo, but u go USA and ur truck man√≠a I guess"
How many Cyber Truck reviews are there ü§™
"sry im late marques, i was listening to waveform"
"I daily drove a half ton for 5 years and hated it for that purpose, but I used it for truck things weekly, now it's paid for, and sits in the driveway, waiting to do what it was supposed to, like towing and hauling. I get that people will use this as an oversized suv, but no thanks. Like he said, people who really use their trucks won't even consider this."
"Duct tape 
A man‚Äôs best tool üòÇ"
The car used here was also a 911 turbo vs a regular 911 that elon used.
steer by wire is just mouse acceleration for cars
"hell, i still get flipped of by the ""compensator 5000"" trucks that populate my area. a few have even swerved at me. like, dude. you do realize if you were to actually hit me, it would all be recorded and your ass would be sued to oblivion and back, right? lol."
"Great review, missed opportunity to get peoples verbal reactions"
"Stop light to stop light in a 6 thousand pound truck and losing control, that will be in the news at some point"
Marques continues to be my favorite YouTuber. 10/10 quality and so entertaining to watch!
Marques this production is fire üî•üî•üî•
Until all the copycats come out and then no one's going to care
"yo I think you forgot to link to the Engineering Explained video you mentioned. Awesome video btw, production value through the roof üî•"
"11:33 63 is ""37"" away from 100 (see @Veritasium)"
"""The most dangerous thing"", indeed. Incredibly, shameful bad take on the bicyclist's thumb down: zero chance of surviving even a modest hit as a bicyclist. Shame on you Marques."
absolute cinema
Marques wearing the Deutscher Frisbee-Sport Verband jersey in the video - how cool is that? Greetings from Germany!
Love the style on this one. Definitely kept me engaged.
"Great video Marques! One of your best ever. I think the thing for me is how much they overpromised and under-delivered. They promised 500 mile range, and $40k price. And all of that would have made the ugliness of this vehicle something people could have overlooked. But the $100K price tag and basically a 250 mile range is just bonkers. I think it will end up being a fad, and something that will lose its iconic status quickly. Tesla will have to deliver on its promises otherwise I feel the CyberTruck will disappear into obscurity."
This video is completely detailed
"Yep iconic, like the edsel‚Ä¶."
Well done mate!
Were you driving around in the Bricks to test it‚Äôs bulletproofedness? ü§£ that looked like Ironbound.
More like a weirdo than iconic.
I love this guy. Do you?
"My question is: how the fuck did they get the sound with no echo in a huge empty warehouse? 
Ok, you can hear a tiny bit of echo, but damn, this is impressive"
All of these ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt need to do this‚Äù reviews don‚Äôt recognize that these technologies are being tested for the compact car coming next
"What about steering by Torque vectoring, where on wheel has more power than the other side making the truck go towards that direction."
I guess another incentive for americans to buy a dangerous car
"Yuo sre not be fine if yuo gat trap in that thing , to cut stenless steel yu , well the rescue team gone nead a oxingen cuting tourch to cut that , and that is not good"
Jerryrigeverything all shot up his cybertruck check it out if you haven't seen it
You are the only one that can truly punk üòÇ Elon Musk.
"17:09 ""While my child ... I mean the car"" üòÇ
I understand how you feel Marques ü•≤"
"It's iconic because the Cybertruck is ugly; that's not a knock on Tesla, I think its cars are cool‚Äîjust not that ugly thing."
17:09 your child? üòÇ
Just finished Doug's video. Impeccable timing.
It's garbage.
"so a general question , may be i did not get it right , the steering is just connected to wheels via electric wires so how can you steer it if the battery is dead , how to steer it for example into your garage to charge it"
"Only thing iconic about it is Elon musk breaking the ""unbreakable"" windows!"
The cyber trucks aim is to make people think that they are seeing a spaceship on wheels
How many more months do you think it will still be a super cool spectacle to be seen driving a Cybertruck?
I still haven‚Äôt seen one in person yet.
Marques took the Tesla 911 ad personally
"Very nice video, and the Tesla Cybertruck looks cool."
'My Child' xD
that intro sequence was insane
"In person Cybertrucks look like Kit Cars to me, especially the miss-colored doors that Stainless Steel will always give you"
Sick intro üî•
i want one
thats a sick intro. wow.
The Cybertruck: Watch out for the rain.
"I would totally get this if I can afford it, truly the most cutting edge car üò¢"
It‚Äôs not clever. It‚Äôs Á©©Èô£„ÄÇ
"Um, steer by wire was first used by Infiniti almost a decade ago in the Q50, so it may be nice, but revolutionary it is not."
Cuz it rhymes with Ironic?
"‚ÄúCybertruck‚Äù

*First truck with zero haters from auto industry.*"
Marques is a closet case cybertruck/Tesla hater these days (comparing it to the pt-cruiser is the telltale)
"Man, I'm only a year older to you and I remember the PT Cruiser being a love/hate thing. I loved it and even had a little RC car version of it."
TFW you get in the tiniest fender bender in a Tesla and your insurance company totals the car. You‚Äôll see.
"Can‚Äôt wait to get one , I like how elonnjsnt afraid to be unconventional"
There are SO MANY of the B-roll shots of it driving around that it literally looks like a polygon render - maybe due to the camera quality and/or post processing / color grading?
iconic? hahahahaha. unfollowed
"No it‚Äôs not. And the speed thing‚Ä¶make it go around a corner and see what happens. Well said, that‚Äôs the power of marketing. Pointless car"
A swastika is iconic. Doesn't make it good.
"Wow before you got to the comment about the PT Cruiser, I was already thinking that same thing about the PT Cruiser!"
How does drive by wire work in a sudden accident with massive speed change and steering reactions? Genuinely curious!
It is sad how pedestrian safety or safety at large is something that didn't even come up. (Not to mention how it is literally illegal in EU)
Thanks for your perspective!  One note on the suspension.  Roll you have correct but yaw you have incorrect.  What you are referring to is pitch. Yaw is the equivalent of a tail slide.
This video looks like a movie. And I love it.
The Cybertruck will be the retro iconic De Lorean of the 2040s.
this guy is just great
When you tweeted this is yall's best video made yet... You weren't lying
Can we all juat admit the thing looks ridiculous. Who wants to be a laughing stock on the road?
visually pleasing video. the asthetics are so futuristic and clean
the pothole creator
Without government handouts Tesla would have never been profitable
"Great, great, great video"
Well I mean the cyber truck has been in the making since 2019 so it makes sense that people will act different around it
It was really cool and weird the first time seeing it. Them after that each time felt more and more normally
Ps I always said it reminds me of Iron man. Think about it
How much is the auto insurance for this thing?
"Wont be watching this.  GT40.  Iconic.  911.  Iconic.  300SLR.  Iconic.  53 Vette.  Iconic.  Jag E Type.  Iconic.  

Cybertruck.  Will be forgotten in 6 years if not sooner."
"The cyber truck is not the PT cruiser, that thing was never cool, so bad comparison."
i think it looks awesome reminds me of a warthog from halo
.
"Only Marques would made a video with so many downsides of a product (without mentioning the infamous crumpling zones) and ending with the hope that it will become mainstream.

I'm just saying that if was a chinese brand with the exact same car, the tone of the video would be different. We all know Marques has a soft spot for Apple and Tesla products."
That's true and I work for tesla. People go nuts over it. It's so different people just want pics of it.
"Man, the production of this video is next level. Shout out to Marques and the team for stepping up the game üëèüèΩ"
If this truck ever gets submerged under water you will never be able to brake out the windows to escape!!!
@MarquesBrownlee Baller move taking out your 911 against it. üî•
"The Cybertruck is so different it has everyone's eyes on it , even if you don't like it üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
I think it's an important vehicle but not one i would consider buying.
"Interesting topic you raised: the disconnect from online to real life people, where I live it's huge"
a door falling off isnt exactly something that should be on the road.
No one in the right mind will buy this car
"That's pitch, not yaw. 
Love these things. Hope to get one someday."
Cybertruck is sick
"To me Tesla have shown to be bit deceptive in their claims and marketing, which is my main reason not to buy their cars early. I prefer proven models üòä"
The Delorean is Iconic. This thing is a Delorean on steroids.
People are talking about it! And that's why it was a clever move by Tesla.
"Wtf, how are you not a car reviewer"
Best cyber truck review I‚Äôve ever seen
Sci fi ‚ùå refrigerator on wheel ‚úÖ
Top Gear vibes üëå
Personally I‚Äôm not fine with 63% of people buying trucks purely for their ego‚Äôs. They‚Äôre dangerous to other road users and take up too much space. It‚Äôs the narcissists car choice.
Awesome video
Whiteboard >>>
Great video as per usual.
Hard to ignore the Nazi owner‚Ä¶
Cybertruck is in no way as ugly as a PT cruiser I'm sorry it isn't even a possibility dude hahaha
The most dangerous thing is the owner that thinks they are doing good to the üåç
"I think if they used standard fiberglass with the steel as an option or not at all and paid a little more attention to the annoyances of the unusual design of the truck for daily use it would  be a little bit more appealing of a option to consider in the electric truck market.

It just feels like there's a better options for whatever you want a electric truck for and the only real reason you would pick the cybertruck is for the status symbol which is as valid as any other reason but hard to justify when it's the only reason."
WOW!! This video is better than a Scorsese movie
Can't wait for people to go grocery shopping in their personal tanks!
This is like buying a Mercedes in 1943.
HOW ABOUT STEAM GAMING?!
okay who here expect marques to dragrace his porsche
"Maybe I am in the minority here but to me what Marques is saying, about the first additions of the car having a lot of imperfections is unacceptable. if I‚Äôm paying for an expensive object I expect it to be in its basically final condition and where the dev team is 100% satisfied with. I am not only talking about the Cybertruck here btw. Sure software updates here and there are normal I would say (unless the current software is unusable) but actual material things that have a big impact on how the car looks (like panel gaps or drives should have been send straight back to the factory for further dialing in. I am not hugely into cars so I don‚Äôt know everything, but it seems to be a fairly unique thing for a car company to do this to its consumers especially if  those brands that have been around for a very long time . Maybe that‚Äôs the issue maybe I‚Äôm not comparing Tesla with the right companies

To me it just seems odd in the car industry that a car company is using its consumers to be test subjects while they have to pay full price for it and then when those consumers see lot of (deal breaking) issues with the car they are not able to get their money back. It just seems very wrong like I said, especially when the object (in this case a car) is so expensive. I know this happens with a lot of other non car companies (like the gaming industry) but like I said for a car company, it seems to be uncommon"
Next time put them in King Kong too. King Kong!!!
If i saw freaking Marques on a cybertruck while on the street i would take a picture too ngl...
"I mean cool, but just highlights the fact Americans buy massive cars to smash each other and only drive them to the supermarket, they pretend it's as fun to drive as a car because it accelerates as fast.. on glue

Im Europe, and I'd rather have a Porsche Taycan, but I can't have one anyways since it'll smash pedestrians (aka us)"
Great video. Probably the best cybertruck breakdown I‚Äôve seen.
"if i won a lottery, the only overprice thing i would buy would be cybertruck, it will be a eye catching in our country and i could atleast drive it daily for work than buying a lambo or any other sports car out there"
<3
It looks like the cars I would draw on my peechee folders in the 3rd grade
That rear slope angle and sharp back end are nearly perfect subsonic aerodynamics.
This is definitely not shot on an iphone
"Good video.  I just rode in a friend's Cyber Truck today for the first time. I absolutely love this thing.  It is beautiful. I have owned pickups and would love this.  I don't really need a truck this size anymore, but it is fantastic.  He still has the mirror on the windshield, but it is mostly useless.  Comfortable truck and very roomy for my 6'4"" frame.  I sat in back and front. He has been using it for the past month shlepping dirt, decorative rocks, and bricks for his parents' house.  The turning radius is amazing.  There was a video out there where teh YouTuber shot the door with a .22, a .50 caliber, and a few other weapons. The .22 did not go through but the .50 caliber made a decent hole."
"When we got our Model Y Performance we were only the 2nd or 3rd Tesla in our area, and the only performance. We used to have people recording us constantly and stopping to ask about it, but now, it's just another tesla in the area"
Sideview yuk..apart from that it has alot of potential
"my q50 has steer by wire, and i hate it. ZERO steering feel. my logitech g923 has more steering feel. i hope tesla did a better job than infiniti"
"who let this video cook, bro I'm watching a movie rn"
It's a Battlestar Galactica 1979 set piece. I would never consider buying one even if I had money to spare.
The cool kids drive a UFO.
"The VW Beetle is iconic. The Mini is iconic. I don't think for something to be iconic it has to be rare.
Personally I do not care about cars at all. I specifically dislike SUVs and trucks. And I am also ... not a Musk fan. 
But I think the only thing that will determine if something is iconic or not is time.
Let's come back to this in 20-30 years. Then we will know."
I super love this car. My shelves and target list. Haha
My one and only complaint with the Cyber truck is that is extremely unsafe!  You yourself Marques alluded to this fact but decided not to talk about it.  You hit someone with this truck they are basically dead.  How can any car / truck / van / etc meant for driving on normal ass roads not have crumple zones??  I have been and will always will be bewildered how this is legal!
That statistic on the use-cases of most truck owners really just baffles me...if you don't tow or haul anything..THEN WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU NEED A HUGE ASS TRUCK FOR?!?!
Grumpy bicycle riders sounds about right. Lol
It gives me F-117 Nighthawk vibes :))
drive by wire fine till the stick drift shows up
"Marques posts video. I watch. Happy Friday, all."
You shoulda done a K-turn. Maybe next time.
Is the left headlight flickering?
"I officially declare this is THE review for CyberTruck, the only review that matters and the only one we need. Detailed, interesting, and very fun to watch. Great!"
"OFF ROADING IS UNDERRATED massive ground clearance, can go through SUPER deep water, great offroad performance and torque, especially considering the weight of it. For the average joe who wants to daily and have off road fun its amazing!"
"If you don't need to tow or haul, you should not have a truck"
the camera work is so crazy good it feels like im watching a movie almost
"Who the fuck is taking a truck on a ""pleasure drive""? Yeah, love that body roll feeling! Love that land yacht feel out on the open neighborhood streets!"
"One of the most well filmed car reviews i've ever seen, TV and YouTube combined"
"I disagree that physical buttons are better. A good touchscreen is better than physical buttons. Physical buttons feel outdated after driving a Tesla for a little while.
Furthermore, if Tesla has their way, nobody will be using most of the controls within 2-3 years. It'll be fully autonomous."
I feel like once the novelty wears off no one‚Äôs going to be buying the truck and Elon will have to discontinue it
An icon of rust!
Turdy Truck
Thank you europe for not allowing this nonsense
I do frequent light towing and this will be perfect. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è PT cruiser wasn't the future
it's definitely the iconic car. Thanks for the awesome review.
Model 3 is still my favourite
"Man! If this video‚Äîthis particular video‚Äîwas a hand-made sculpture, you‚Äôd appreciate every single bit of it, because this video‚Ä¶ is well thought out. I appreciate that."
i think the first to push variable steering was bmw and the first full steer by wire was a lexus
The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is that the trunk will chop off your fingers when closing
"Speaking of iconic, serious shoutout to the person or people making your intros. IIRC, it's one dude, but damn. This one and the iPhone 15 review intro were both incredibly well done."
I think the Cybertruck will go the way of the Hummer.  When the H1 and H2 came out they were in every rap video and all the celebrities owned one.  These days you rarely see a Hummer on the street.  The CT will have a 10 year run and then no one will care or buy them.
This is definitely the EV PT Cruiser...
"Am I gonna be fine though if someone hits me? My car might be, but will I be?"
"I honestly don't understand this trend of simply accepting to buy unfinisched products, calling engineering errors and factory defects as ""quirks"". These things cost tens of thousends of dollars and people are supposed to be beta testers?"
Huh ya know the end of this video really is something to think about. I mean the PT Cruiser was at release a really cool car. I knew a ton of people with them and they were kind of a head turner. To think though that CyberTruck could share that same fate is wild but when unique things become mainstream they lose that appeal.
How did you do that vibration thing with my phone on the intro üò¶
"Like = the cybertruck is cool
Dislike = the cybertruck is not cool"
"cybertruck is an ugly crappy truck and its already bombing past the novelty. Im not a Tesla hater,  but I think this was a waste of resources and it could have been much much better"
"This truck is absolutely, positively ugly. It reminds me of the Hummer. Everybody was talking about it when it came out. Turned out to be a total dude in the end. I think this truck will suffer the same fate. Once the hype is over it will fizzle. Too ugly, too impractical and it has all kind of reliability issues. Good luck Tesla."
Skyline civic supra mass produced legendary cars
Am I the only one who thinks that if Ironman had a truck this would be it?
"The thing is .. well it isn't really so alright that the majority of SUV or cybertruck owners will never either tow or offroad.  Because they might more economically to themselves and to the planet just buy a regular car, make it electric if they want.  Bigger and heavier does not often mean better, just nobody told the whole of North America that, in fact they told them quite the reverse, and decades later SUVs are sadly the norm."
Clearly Marques knew it's important review... and he and whole team DELIVERED. This video is like poetry. It's art.
Definitely head turning ‚ù§
It gets attention because it's absolutely hideous. Give it a year and people will stop freaking out.
Again? üòÇ
"PT Cruiser, Plymouth Prowler and even the VW Beetle (original and reboot) were all iconic and mass produced. Outside of the original Beetle, none have held on to that status."
"When he pulled up a Porsche 911 
I that's what an mkbhd video is‚ò†Ô∏èü§ç"
"Electric cars are just a huge L, theyre not better for the enviroment!"
"Steer by wire has been a thing for over 10 years, Infiniti had it in 2013."
That is why this is the best channel on the net. Elon furious. Might end up selling twitter. Love it.
üá©üá™üá©üá™üëçüëç
shout out the people filming horizontally
Why are you reviewing cars?
Wow what a detailed review
I disagree with Marquez for once. I think this car is a joke and the rest of the world thinks it's horrible.
"Lol, i love how Marques put's his hood up before getting out, for continuity, except he magically gained a coat."
This car was not made for the simple minds
"To bad this is just a bought and paid advertisement for the truck. So many things wrong with it including rusting. We get it, make a good video millions will see and help sell us the truck, I get i I get it"
"In Elon Musk‚Äôs biography by Walter Isaacson, there‚Äôs an entire chapter about the Cybertruck and is absolutely worth the read. You get so much insight about why decisions were made, especially on its design."
The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is how it deals with bird poop üí©
Cybertruck is underrated button ‚úÖ
"Living in the Bay Area, I've seen more than one cybertruck around. I don't get the attraction. It's not like it's a Pagani Zonda."
hey marques I want to correct you about the Tesla being the first company to deploy steer by wire but it‚Äôs actually Lexus
"I'm going put it out there, the design of this vehicle repulses me. However I can see what it's trying to be, a start in a new trend."
Feet over meters? :(
seems like unnecessary defending of cybertruck tbh
They should've offered a model that breaks the wall behind the rear seats to feel more like a SUV. I'd love to have a play room for my dogs while I drive. Maybe even a bed for me and friends on road trips.
I would submit that the VW Beetle is an iconic design that was also highly mass-produced. Cybertruck will be the same
Its a pointless vehicle that looks amazing..
It's disgusting :)
I could tell how much you really enjoyed making this video. It turned out awesome!
"Imagine having a collusion with this metal box on wheels , carnage"
"I‚Äôve been waiting for this, I love the way it looks as well."
"The thing that really sucks about it IMO is how dangerous it would be to other road users, it's made out of steel, if you crash into a car or someone, they're almost certainly gonna die

Normal cars are designed to be ""crash compatible"", which means that if one crashes into another, there's a decent chance both parties will survive if speeds weren't high enough and you're lucky

This thing is a driving metal brick, I'm kinda glad it isn't coming to Europe

Edit: To clarify: I'm talking about a collission someone in a normal car and the truck, not the truck and a wall. Also this would mostly be a problem if people were to use this instead of their car, which this video implies is the main target audience of this truck because it doesn't tow very well"
"broooo how many cybertruck videos are you gonna make ????   I used to like your videos , you should tell us if you own Tesla stocks , I mean just be honnest"
The best one yet. Nice work!
online comments hate the cybertruck because those comments are paid for by tesla detractors and legacy auto
The day MKBHD becomes another sellout.
The production value of this video is so good
I Really like this pickup truck
"It's not good looking it's not practical, that's the car I used to draw as a 6 year old, and it's electric,  and steer by wire if you telling me that car has no steering column no one should ever drive that car it's not safe, I mean what happens if your steering motor stops working"
It‚Äôs like driving in a video game where the graphics haven‚Äôt loaded properly.
"‚ÄúMy child‚Äú - ‚Äúnot stock‚Äù lol, good shit MKBHD"
"It has to be one of the most pedestrian-hazardous passenger vehicles ever designed, and that‚Äôs taking into account the explosion of flat-grilled trucks and suvs over recent decades. People are going to get hit by this and their injuries will be a lot worse than if it were designed a little bit more with the safety of others in mind."
A 3 hour running car thay take 12 or 40 hours to charge at $100 par month and a replacement battery at 60k...you call that iconic üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
It's literally what robocop would drive
This design is very human
Negative comments exist in quantity for the same reason negative restaurant reviews exist - only people who feel strongly about it will leave one
"I'd say it's not fine to see more of these on the road, but for the same reason that their use is equated to SUVs.  They are heavier, more durable, and have a height that is as dangerous (I'd say more dangerous) than a regular SUV.  The disregard for safety in terms of collision as well as pedestrian traffic is unsettling."
My Ford expedition to tow and my future cyber truck for driving. My current F150 can't even pull my boat. I agree that most people don't neeeed it to tow.
"Tesla have explained why it looks like this‚Äîform follows function because they can't form this thick steel into curves, though they can create simple bends. As an artist, I like its planar simplicity."
This car only happens because of Elon lmao.
I thought you already made a review about this car ? Several videos in fact. I like how big companies get free ads and alot of attention. And small good companies work hard and get no public attention. I'm sick of this car
It's one of kind. Very special
0:17 I love it‚ù§
"No. it is not, it will go down as ugly and pointless as a truck. A grocery getter, but not a useful truck. The Maverick and Hyundai small truck are better than this."
This was probably the best produced video you've made. Well done.
"What a masterpiece of a video, great cinematography"
I think the steer by wire would be interesting in trucks and buses where you have a lot of ratio for a big vehicle to turn!
"Honestly, it¬¥s so fucking ugly and useless. Like the tech features seem fine but the chassis itself looks like shit and is completely impractical."
"Nice try, trying to convince us it‚Äôs good looking"
Looks dope
It's a shit car.
One of the plus I can think of is that haters are going to have a hard time keying this car. And there are going to be a lot of haters with this one lol
"It‚Äôs a Ginsu Knife on wheels, wouldn‚Äôt exist if America had Pedestrian Safety Laws, like most of the World. But as long as y‚Äôall ok inside your Tank, bugger anyone around you."
It looks way more like an suv.
"I have seen three in Austin so far. The first one, I screamed with all the people on the bus, all of us taking pictures and fist bumping.. Now I am just like man, that has a lot of fingerprints on it. I would still drive one if it was free tho."
I love it ‚ù£Ô∏è
"You can hate on this thing all you want, and some of it is certainly warranted. But the engineering of this thing is just absolutely next level."
"I didn't like it at the beginning, but the more I look, the more I like it"
"If rarity is a mark of an icon, how do we classify cars like the Beetle?"
Moving refrigerator gets me üíÄ
i think what's iconic about the cybertruck is how bad it looks. people take pictures of ferraris and cool cars cuz they look appealing. the only thing that's appealing about a cybertruck is that you will not survive an accident against one and it will literally decapitate you if you are 5'9 or smaller
14:33 getting really Grand Tour/Top Gear here. Love it ü§©
"Iconic for being crap, sucks off-road, can't even go off-road because of its stainless steel needing to be cleaned or it ruins it, rusting issues, panel gaps 1 AU wide, subscription diffs, poor range especially in the cold, and it looks ugly. 0-60 Pony and nothing else."
"Wow! that was ""Top Gear"" kinda review."
maybe its the delorean of our time
The porsche from the commercial was probably a 911 carrera which only has 385 hp
It will go away in 6 months ‚ù§100%
"üá∫üá∏: CyberTruck

10:59 nice reading a whole page of text while driving
"sorry Marques, but SCREW TESLA."
Wow great video. Going from the Tesla promo video to you drag racing in your own 911 was sick. Plans to make a main channel video on your child? I mean 911 Turbo S?
It's so dumb.
Bro brought in 2 cyber trucks hahahaha :) this guy knows how to make a difference.
"I love MKBHD. This video, the quality in general is awesome. With all that being said, the Cybertruck is a joke."
9:30 You have to disclose your stock holdings Marques. Willing Beta tester? Why didnt you give fisker a break again?
Dope retro animation ü§© Didn't expect a drag race üòé Great video as always!üíØ
The words 'quick' and 'fast' don't mean what you think they mean
Iconically rusting
THAT INTRO WAS DOPE
"already iconic and future proofed?
amazing video as always"
"12:51 bro you cannot get mad at people for doing the shit that the main fucking marketer, Elon, is telling them that they can fucking do. This is the guy that was saying it‚Äôs gonna be bulletproof, so why do you think people are out there testing and breaking it? He gives it all these different claims, and people are going to take him out his word, because he‚Äôs the main marketer, which you seem to do as well"
The the bullet proof feature was just a side benefit. And wasnt intentional. Tesla kinda just ran with itüòÇ
This dude is Genius üî•üî•üôåüíØüëç
Economy lookin rough in the B-roll
Matte Black when?
Cyber Truck is futuristic. How I wish it uses combustion engine so that many across the world could have access to it.
The Cult of Elon is real.
I was here and now am gone..
Congrats on making the us national team for ultimate man
"It‚Äôs his child ‚ù§, and it‚Äôs not stock ‚ù§‚ù§"
so this truck gets 4 videos from MKBHD - more than any other car review he does! Says it all.
"naah man, you waited for doug demuro's review first"
Man had to tape the door of his new 1000k+ a few days in ü§£. But let‚Äôs not say a bad word about Daddy Elon üòÇ
Sick Intro!
I‚Äôm choosing to like my own comment
Airbus airplanes are ALL fly by wire. It works.
If it isn't a decent truck it's not going to last. Nobody cares if the side panels can survive a weak hand gun. Plus are you really going to be fine in a crash? What happened to crumple zones?
üëã
RoboCop Car
Iconic trash yeah üéâ
"Iconic 
But 
For  piece of ugliness .

I know you guys push it on all the s media but the truth is that is the uglier vehicle ever.
Beats up even the fiat multipla ü§Æ"
My issue with Tesla is the single gear there‚Äôs always a better way with gearing
"There's so many red flags with this as a vehicle and I hope in the future Tesla removes those for the safety (both physical and financial) of the user.
-Crumple problems for accidents
-Fast acceleration (For a truck)
-Glare
-Tech in everything (and if you know cars / Tesla, that tech is *expensive* to repair).
-A worse truck bed.

Looks cool though, wish tesla would allow for better paint jobs."
I saw this truck in real life out of nowhere when riding my ebike lol
Love your reviews marques!
"On the autofocus video Marques seemed distressed, not sure if was the broken door or the geese or the unwanted attention or what"
Man the quality !! Just waooo
When I was 5 years old I drew a car that was better than this design.
Why does that intro music go so hard? I gotta go do some push ups before i can watch the rest of this
Yep. There is nothing quite like it.
The front of the cybertruck looks like jaws of a shark what do u guys think? üòÖ
That 911 Tesla Ad should be considered false advertising.
put the 911 and the cybertruck on the nordschleife :S
"my parents had  a PT Cruiser* for many years, I've driven many times as well.  I can tell you it's absolute dogshit. It only holds the title of ""different looking"", right up there with the Plymouth Prowler and the Chevy SSR among many.  If you want to talk about being iconic on the mass produced scale, you should probably name something like the Honda Civic or Ford Bronco"
It‚Äôs a status symbol
Is it rusting?
7:30 the car will be fine... You might not be as crumple zones exist for a reason and it looks like the cyber truck has none...
YA IT MAKES ME WANT TO TIP IT OVER!!!! OR put it back in the hot wheels isle at toys'r us which is now OBSOLETE where the cyber truck belongs!!! OR let me have that sheet metal so i can make some thunderstorm sound effects......... UFFF

"4:40 steer by wire system   5:50 ‚ÄúI believe they‚Äôre the first ones to do this‚Äù

"Don‚Äôt like this truck at all as an actual vehicle to use, but seeing it in person is truly amazing. The dealer I saw it at had one of those new Hummer EVs as well, and this truck still looks way bigger due to the lack of design. It‚Äôs truly absurd and I love that aspect of it. I do think it would look cool with one of those sand dune colors in matte to give it a military-like look. Even though I wouldn‚Äôt ever want one, I can see why some would just because of how different it is.

Edit: Why is there no center cap on the wheels? Unless that‚Äôs for the wheel caps that were supposed to come with them."
COLD ROLLED STAINLESS STEEL ALLOY IS GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN A CAR. THATS THE SHOPPING CART AT THE BACK OF A PARKING LOT.
"Like if you have seen the cybertruck or want to see it in real life 
üëáüèº"
"Woah, miles collab? Fantastic!"
"Unclear if it's technically ""steer by wire"" but newer Ford F150s do have an ""Adaptive Steering"" feature that, when enabled, dynamically changes the steering ratio. Though, it's not very dramatic, which maybe could be configurable through forscan. I think this is undersold by Ford intentionally because traditional F150 customers wouldn't like the idea/marketing of ""steer by wire""."
What we've been waiting for üòÇ
When will you do another FSD video?
"No way Marques has a child, that can drive"

10:15 nice timing on all three
Looks like Marques took Tesla's Cyber truck vs 911 race video bit personally.
"The developers of the Cybertruck must have bad graphics, but the truck in my opinion still looks pretty cool."
So how do they keep that black plastic from getting all sun damaged? That was one thing on the Chevy avalanche that made it look like trash.
You look jaundiced bro 13:50

"I am leaving this comment here so that after some hours, days, weeks, months or years when someone likes or comment on it, I will be reminded to watch this video again"
No offense Marques but crazy how you are so light on Tesla's Cybertruck issues that are being addressed. Yet so harsh against a NEW car company FISKER's Ocean with issues that they were also addressing. Mind boggling how you almost single-handedly ruined Fiskers future with one review
Coolest ‚Äòcar‚Äô on the road
"The spinning heads its just a temporary honeymoon phase, once it becomes more common and acceptable in society, no one will care.  It‚Äôs just a novelty at the moment."
üó£Ô∏è does it come in black??
i couldn't expect anything else from a tech bro channel. i love mkbhd but when it comes to cars he knows next to nothing besides what size screen the thing has. ill pass on this vid lmao
"Car builders limit top speed, not because of tires, but breaking...   The ability to dump heat to a safe stop is what makes even the same car have different top speeds out the door new from dealers... so you can get a Mustang GT, Base with 1 limit, and a GT performance pack, same HP motor, will get a higher over all limit"
The most dangerous thing about that truck is how ugly it is. üòÅ
Better than the actual Tesla event
"This behemoth technically requires non-commercial Class A license. 

Insurance on this will be crazy soon."
Not gonna lie I'd be more hype to see you on the road than the Cybertruck haha
"Wow the production into this video is insane
Mkbhd with a redo in 2024‚ù§"
"My 2500HD sucks for towing, too. I get about 8mpg in that thing with a 20' tandem axle enclosed job trailer."
The JET BLACK CYBER TRUCK in Future and Metros video is üî•
Yet again Marques shows off cool tech I can't afford üò≠
Mkb
L take
Most over used word ever ‚ÄûIconic‚Äú
not even close
I live by Tesla Fremont I would be nervous around are area because there is lots of car jacking someone is going to want to still 1 just to say they drove a cyber truck it will happen people need to be very careful keep you‚Äôre eyes üëÄ open
wow that's a great video
Something definitely can be iconic‚Ä¶ just not in a good way (see: the Hindenburg)
Floss factor.
"Guys, watch Adam Something's fantastic video on Cybertruck that he uploaded about a week ago. Way more honest too!"
"Wow, this vehicle can do many things and has great functions"
Refreshing seeing something different on the roads
THE QUALITY AAAAAAAA THE TRANSITIONS AAAAAAAAAA!!!!
That's a reupload!
Two cybertrucks to remind me how broke I am ‚ò†Ô∏è
Trash
this video is so sicküî•üî• the Cybertruck looks like CGI ....wow this is one of your best video ever üî•üî•
"Clever??? Come on MKBHD, Telsa clearly lied here..."
It's the first time I get to see a futuristic Hot Wheel car come to life. It's so stupidly awesome.
"That first line once Video starts (AFTER the BEHAVIOR QUE) was EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT but COULDN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS due to so much CONFUSION about the damn... CYbErrr ""tRrUuCcKk "" 
üë®üèø‚Äçüíª Marques üë®üèø‚Äçüíª "" I Genuinely can't tell if the Cyber Truck is, GOOD LOOKING ... Or NOT ü•¥ An I'm being COMPLETELY SERIOUS!!! "" üòÖüòÜ

You honestly üî®ü§°, Bro üéØüëåüèΩ"
"is this promo or regular video? Because there are SO MANY cyber truck videos, even on your channel, so, why I am watching it again?:)"
"Bro, you in Jersey. What do you expect we already drive wrecklessly."
"The comments here pretty much sum up how bad this ""truck"" is."
7:28 the question is if HE will be fine üòÖ
All I am seeing is a DeLorean driving backwards
this truck looks so f*cking cool
The 2023 Lexus RZ did steer by wire earlier. (not saying Tesla's isn't impressive)
Iconic like a Flaming Bag of Crap
Yeah - its bulletproof.
"TikTok will not make you feel famous, there are too many kids dancing around. The CYBERTRUCK will."
Iconically looks bad. Saw that shit in the street and realize how bad the outside looks.
Why do people keep pretending that this thing isn't the most hideous car produced since the Pontiac Aztec?
Run Marquez Run
"I rode in one recently, and everyone we drove past was turning their heads. We even stopped to let people see it, I loved seeing people's reactions to the futuristic beast it is."
Ligma
Cyber Truck and TechImma1st
"17:24 Also EV motors instantly put gear and accelerate, meanwhile manual shift is all about practice of the driver"
This has to be the most crappy looking truck ever made as if it was drawn by a schoolboy that wanted to draw the car of the future
Irrelevant more like.
"cool video editing ... the 80's vibe, computer generated wireframe construct ..."
I saw one on the road yesterday and I‚Äôm not a fan.
Trucks aren't for towing. They have a bed to haul stuff. The bed is why you get a truck for hauling.
First hr gang like here
Best intro ever
I‚Äôm the only one that don‚Äôt like this thing
you're intros are becoming a bit much and cringe
whens Elon Musk getting on the waveform podcast?
The Lexus RZ was the first car to have steer by wire to my knowledge.
Looks like a Prius‚Äôs dad.
Its an expensive golf car
Auto-Focus channel lost his job üòÇ
The Cybertruck is the 3rd wonder of the world of cars üëå
"Marques is a G, without even trying to be a G."
"I think this truck is one of the ugliest thing ever. I think Mr Elon just aprove this design just to laught on how easy it is to manipulate people, creating something ugly with just a badge (Expensive) ."
"The secret is that Americans are obsessed with image. The number of people who *need* a truck has not changed from 50 years ago, but the number of people who buy them has increased 30x or more."
"if by iconic you mean comic - like the Pontiac Aztek, then yeah. This dumpster fire of a billionaire's wet dream is going to become the joke punchline of the 2030s."
hi
I COULDNT GET PAST THE FIRST MINUTE WITHOUT SENDING IT BACK
"somehow this car is a true representative of Elon himself. You will mostly hate it, some will love it.... but most won't be able to ignore it !"
Congrats on being selected for Team USA Marques! üéâüéâüéâ
Esperando as legendas pra assistir daqui do a Brasil
It must be cool driving an american fridge
üëç
"The intro is really cool
broüéâüëè"
A truck so good that it is banned in the UK and most of Europe for failing to meet the bare minimum safety requirements üòÇüòÇ
The comments are either not real people or they are people who actually never go outside and the Cybertruck proves it. The people outside who see it IRL *LOVE* it. lol
THIS REVIEW IS INSANE !!! THE SOUND IS TOP NOTCH. JUST SICK
"I guess steer by wire could vastly simplify self-driving, maybe they're looking ahead, but I don't understand why did they do it with the cyber truck and not the other cars, so if we don't see steer by wire in the next coming suv Tesla's, I'm probably wrong"
Pretty eye catching... right up until it isn't. Everything gets boring after a while.
"I love the design, finally something completly diffrent looking car"
It also cant drive sand.
"""We dug our own grave with the Cybertruck"" ~ Elon Musk. The man's own words. LOL"
"‚ÄúIconic‚Äù üôÑ

Yeah, time to unsub from MKBHD. There are only so many wrong and bad takes, poorly reasoned ideas and poorly researched ‚Äúreviews‚Äù I can handle in one lifetime."
I say people took pictures because you were sitting in the truck and not because of it! üòÅ
The most dangerous thing is if you sell it to anyone tesla will ruin you ...üòÖ
Not a Musk fan but the people and engineers at Tesla are doing impressive industry changing stuff. This time they actually made something I really want but will never own until the prices come down üòÇ
Thanks for repping NJ. It‚Äôs cool to know that one of the biggest tech YouTubers is based out of Jersey instead of moving to California like a lot of others do
"Or it could just be, ""is that MKBHD ?"" reaction"
Steer by wire on the model 3 Ludacris or eventually on all of their line up would be amazing.
‚ÄúYour momma‚Ä¶‚Äù is an iconic joke. So is the Cybertruck
Cybertruck is a piece of crap. Probably a scam.
0:54 that intro is sliiiickkk üòçüòçüòç
I would love a cyber car
"2:37 If they cut the pointy corners on the back and just make it a flat dull edge, I think it would actually look nice."
still looks werid to me hahahah
Massive props to the Cybertruck engineers for transforming sci-fi fantasies into a jaw-dropping reality!
Intro: üî•üî•
The flatbed for people who want to pretend to have a flatbed has arrived! ‚ù§
Ain¬¥t the Lexus the first with steer by wire thingy?
"There's no beating around the bush: This car is a monstrosity. 
Kudos to Tesla's marketing for creating the most horrible car in human history and making people interested in it."
Most dangerous part is that the trunk will take off your fingers when closing
Iconic for car wrecking. That‚Äôs it
sooo how many of these have sold in Q1 so far?
I want your hammer!! Are you selling it?
"it is a lego looking car, people will definitely look at it weirdly"
AMERICAN ICON. MOST AMERICAN TRUCK EVER ASSEMBLED...
The retention just from the opening line is the videoüëçüëèüëèüëè
Oh how I want an EV but oh how I also want EV prices to drop more lol
Sick intro. The animation remind me of Tron
"CT is the baddest thing on 4 wheels today, and you can't change my mind. The damn thing just looks like the future."
The most dangerous thing is that it doesn't crumble and make the passangers into pudim
Why didn't you throw in some footage on (against under) Pulaski Skyway?
what if its not the car they are excited to see marques
I personally love the look of it. But I'm also not a pickup truck person at all. I'm european so I literally drive an electric Fiat 500.
Without a doubt this is the ugliest vehicle ever made
That Cybertruck has got to have a blind spot of at least 30 seated kids..
Already tragic comic.
9:07 Uh oh. You dead named Twitter.
What‚Äôs parts of town you driving around üò©
How many times is Tesla going to pay you to review this ? Review over we don‚Äôt need constant coverage of this car
The introooo!!üî•üî•üî•
Sick Intro dude! Nailed it!
It‚Äôs not good looking. I can appreciate something so different existing though.
I think I saw you on the parkway the other day
W
It's iconic in the same way a lifted F150 with truck nuts or a jeep with angry headlights are iconic
sorry but first
Awesome stuff
And of course it will be NJ people. I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt get the same in LA or SF üòÇ.
"It looks fine. If DeLorean were still around and releasing vehicles today, this is the truck they would make."
meshugar
I wouldn‚Äôt drive it personally but I appreciate ANY car that pushes the rest of the industry out of its curvy comfort zone
"love that intro animation thingy, looks insane"
[ AF ]Plate üßê ü§î
how much does it cost to get it right now? its higher than most thought
VFX guy killed it on this video
Those panel gaps are hilarious.
Cybertruck is NOT overrated button ‚úÖ
"Nope, it's a dud.
Just another dangerous car."
Marques drove Cybertruck so we don't have to.
only 10 thousand views in 7 minutes‚Ä¶ bro really fell off
that is because of you not the car
"A 3 tons daily vehicle makes no sense in our current situation, it's the opposite of reasonable use of energy"
üòÇ then don‚Äôt drive it.
"no way he said that the most dangerous thing about this steel potato is how others behave and not the part where you can get cut, lose your FINGERS if the trunk closes on them, and the rusting or blinding reflections. definitely a paid video üíÄüíÄüíÄ"
This your best video?
"I hate it but it‚Äôs bold and that, people, is how real progress is made, by pushing the envelope"
It's futuristic ‚ù§
"Iconic? No, infamous."
Haven‚Äôt seen one yet button ‚Ä¶
truck < 3 ton battering ram of death
This cybertruck review has been re-released more times than Elder scrolls morrowind. You can double and triple down polishing a turd. It's still a turd.
When is the Rabbit video coming?
Stopping little kids from saying first
"I think ""infamous"" is a better adjective than ""iconic"""
"""Oh look ma, I made a truck, my first vehicle sketch ever!!"" ~ An 8 year old kid as he shows the sketch of a 'truck' to his mom. This ultimately was used as the design for Cybertruck."
"Marques says only good things about bigger  more mature car companies , but , scrutinizes everything about a small car manufacturer to the point that they're basically dead"
yikes
"the intro got me, that first minute (and really the entire thing) was just excellent. Loved the big open spaces."
"It is ugly - the weird trapezoid wheel wheels over round tires drive me nuts.  Overpriced for the quality of materials used on the inside for sure, like all Tesla‚Äôs.  And don‚Äôt get me wrong, the tech is second to none - perhaps the gold standard for EV‚Äôs.  But as a fully functional truck it‚Äôs nothing but a pavement princess.  Take it down my gravel road in the spring when it‚Äôs wet and that heavy truck would sink and become unmanageable.  It‚Äôs not a truck.  It doesn‚Äôt even measure up to the Lightning which has its own set of issues (which for reference, we own and have massive issues with).  We are not yet at a time where EV trucks make any sense when they cannot tow or do truck things without losing mileage or just failing miserably at being a truck."
Why no captions?
"Until and unless Tesla makes a general purpose affordable car for normal people, it makes no sense to be honest. Even Tesla Model 3 is an expensive car all in all."
Free advertisement for Tesla yet again.
It's the vehicle every SECOND GRADER drew brought to life.
Autofocus channel is in tears right now
Intro music is absolutely DOPE
Mid car ü•±
"Ppl who don't like it are just those who either, wanna be different, hate Tesla, hate electric cars or hate Elon. If they had rhe money they WOULD buy one."
"Iconic: relating to or of the nature of an icon; regarded as a representative symbol or as worthy of veneration.
Iconic no, Polarizing yes"
"Its fugly.  Why do you think no actual car manufacturer have come up with something like it?  Ugly and a danger to pedestrians and any other vehicle it will run in to, not to mention the passengers due to lack of crumple zones"
IMO it looks ridiculous
Cybertruck 2077 DLC üòè
"That's Exactly Elon wanted, free marketing :))
I kinda think this design is from future."
no
iconically shit lmao
"It's a tip of what we gonna see in the future, let's wait till 2050."
"The Cyber truck is perfect if you want to spend $100,000 for attention from strangers"
Love my Cybertruck !
I definitely think it looks horrible... but it's definitely unique.
"We live in an amazing time: rockets look like they did in 60‚Äôs sci-fi, and cars look like the ones I drew in grade school. Old is the new new."
cybertruck is underrated
Not iconic
Why is he walking weird? AI? üëÄ
üî• awesometastic !!!
"I don't think they're the first to do drive by wire. Infiniti, Toyota, Lexus have also done this on regular production vehicles and 3 or 4 rarer production vehicles."
"I love the Cybertruck and think it's the future of design, and sad as a society something unique is seen as a negative because its not familiar"
Everyone talking about the intro that i cant see yet bc ive got 2 un skippable ads
New studio?
Would 100% buy it if it was gas powered
I am not sure if back is the best angle ü§£ü§£ü§£
We need the Model 2 ‚Äî> cheaper ev‚Äôs is what we need asap.
We're one minute in and my god we can already tell that the editors went HARD in this video.
5773 person
Cybertruck intro for a Autofocus. That was mad dope! Gotta but go the graphics
Behavior üíÄüí™
the production quality is insane
Love these videos!
"Thw site of deconstruct. Smarth phones, cars, whath next ?"
Cyber truck looks like a*s
Can't wait for a UK version
"For all the online hate the truck got for it's design, nobody can keep their eyes off it when they see it on the road. I've seen a handful of them in person and it's a head turner every time."
Imagine going on the highway and seeing an unrendered car
"6 views in one minute, fell off"
It looks badass and most people that don‚Äôt think so hate Elon or trucks in general
dude will always glaze Tesla and electric cars.
"No views in 0 seconds, Marques really fell off"
"I may be in the minority here, please can you bring back the Retrotech series. It's been a while man."
16:17 is crazy am I rite all other people who watched the whole thing in 2 minutes

I'd have the same reaction if I saw a block of stainless steel with wheels
"now having an heart attack, but lemme watch quick this video before calling an doctor xD"
I can't believe you're reviewing that car! Musk is racist AF. Tesla ain't getting a dime or shine from me.
"The design looks fresh, new and unique but is still a refrigerator from outside and a regular Tesla from inside. The hype will die soon if the truck in itself isn‚Äôt good enough."
dang
It‚Äôs still really weird to see people making making videos about the cybertruck because of how long ago it was announced. The blocked rear view mirror when the back cover is being used is a big design oversight though
Elon musk Tesla stock price is 175.79 let‚Äôs see it after this video üòÇ

It's way over rated. From what I saw of it. It's not very good on gravel or any other loose surfaces.

"Okay, that intro sequence with the spinning camera transitioning into the tron-esque animation was AWESOME"
Its one of the most unreliable vehicles I think the world has ever seen
Ah yes i needed a good reality check this Friday about how little i should believe in humanity's ability to concentrate on steering their vehicle down the road

"If you guys want to see some creativity with the cyber truck, check out supercar Ron's full custom build with the diesel brothers, it's incredible!"
